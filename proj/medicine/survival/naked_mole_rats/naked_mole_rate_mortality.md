This is a comma-separated text file with 11 columns. Each row in the file contains data for one animal. 
Column 1 (‘IsDead’)
	indicates whether the animal was dead or alive at the time these data were compiled. 
Column 2 (‘AnimalID’)
	is a unique identifier for each animal (to facilitate reference/discussion). 
Column 3 (‘BirthDate’)
	is the date-of-birth according to our records (varying degrees of resolution: month/day/year in the ideal case). 
Column 4 (‘Sex’)
	indicates both the sex of the animal (‘M’/'F’ for male/female) and breeding status (addition of a ‘B’ when an individual was known to be a breeder), as documented in our historical records. 
Column 5 (‘Notes’)
	include information on the death or censorship event (classified as described in the previous paragraph). 
Column 6 (‘DeathDate’)
	indicates, for dead/censored animals, the date of that event. It is empty if the animal were still alive at the time of data compilation. 
Column 7 (‘DataDate’)
	indicates the date on which data for that animal was compiled. If the animal were still alive, that date is used as the date-of-censorship. 
Column 8 (‘ValidBirth’)
	indicates whether the birth was single-day-resolution, that is sufficient for inclusion in the analysis set for Figure 1 (‘Y’/'N’ for yes/no). 
Column 9 (‘ValidDeathCen’)
	gives the same indication for the date of death or censorship. 
Column 10 (‘Censored’)
	indicates the classification of death-versus-censorship (‘Y’ indicates censorship). 
Column 11 (‘Lifespan(days)”) gives the number of days of life for all animals with ‘Y’ values (indicating single-day-resolution) in both columns 8 and 9.

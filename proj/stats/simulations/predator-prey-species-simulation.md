build a predator-prey species simulation with an inbuilt procedural world generator and nice features like A* search for pathfinding

graphs outputting the species numbers and I played with some dials to alter the dynamics

What if I did a day/night cycle so I could model out nocturnal creatures and their interplay with others? And could I create an external database for storing and viewing the details of all past simulations? And could I add some 3D spatial coordinates to the landscape and the agents so I could 3D print sculptures if I wanted?

# Protein
e.g. Protein: relative density v Cost per Gram

## AI
By food group, tabulate nutritional value per 100g,
using wikipeadia database, or similar
group output by:
	constituents:
		protein (g), 
		energy (kJ), 
		carbohydrates (g) 
			Sugars (g)
			Dietary fiber (g)
		fat (g), 
		minerals (g), 
		other (g) e.g. water
	cooking method including raw
	+ environmental impact (ESG) 
		+ e.g. compared to animals?
		+ e.g. fix their own nitrogen so needs less fertilizer

nutritional value per 100g 
	food v food group
	nutrients (g|kJ) per 100 grams
	grouped by factor
		constituents
			protein (g), 
			energy (kJ), 
			carbohydrates (g) 
				Sugars (g)
				Dietary fiber (g)
			fat (g), 
			minerals (g), 
			other (g) e.g. water
		raw (g) else cooked (g) varies by cooking method?
		environmental impact (ESG) e.g. compared to animals?
			fix their own nitrogen so needs less fertilizer

## Metrics
$/g: cost ($) per 30g of protein
	merge currencies? and major|lowcost food retailers
		gov RPI index calculation? e.g. FRED
g/g: weight (grams) per 100g of finished food 
	finished: _cooked_, or raw if edable
g/g: weight (grams) per mass of _cooked_ food
	practical comparison 
		raw less relevant if it can’t be consumed raw
	Chicken breast increase in protein density slightly after cooking
	legumes (excl peanuts) will decrease protein density lots

c/g: calories (c|kC|kJ) per 30g of protein
	matches protein cost ($) per 30g of protein
	legumes great value for protein, but fairly high calories

g/c: protein (g) per 100 calories (c|kC|kJ)
	matches protein weight (grams) per 100g of finished food 
	broccoli is 33% protein per calorie >> 80% ground beef
		but low protein density per gram of broccoli
		=> daily protein via broccoli => lots of grams pd

food v food group
	legumes food group associated with lower mortality
	mortality metric?

Factors
lower environmental impact 
	esp compared to animals
	fix their own nitrogen => needs less fertilizer) 
	other nutrients e.g fiber

75600	80160	Hello and welcome to Incident Genius, a bite-sized masterclass in podcast form.
80160	83200	Every Monday and Friday, you'll hear world-leading scientists and experts
83200	86560	talking about the most fascinating ideas in science and technology today.
87200	90320	I'm Jason Goodger, Commissioning Editor at BBC Science Focus.
91440	94640	In the world of games, scoring systems establish a framework
94640	97600	that provides us with clear challenges, motivation
97600	101040	and ultimately delivers a huge amount of fun and pleasure.
101040	106000	However, on the flip side, the increasing tendency to apply rankings and metrics
106000	109200	to almost every area of our personal and professional lives
109200	112640	can have a dehumanising effect, reducing our actions,
112640	116240	performance and even ourselves to a simple string of numbers.
116880	120880	In today's episode, we're joined by C.T. Nguyen, a games researcher
120880	124480	and associate professor of philosophy based at the University of Utah,
124480	129360	to talk about his latest book, The Score, How to Stop Playing Someone Else's Game.
130080	134800	He explains how in the real world, scoring systems typically fail to provide meaning
134800	137200	by focusing on the simplest to measure outcomes.
137840	142160	How purely numerical data is, by definition, lacking in nuance.
142800	145520	How, by concentrating on what we truly value,
145520	148640	we can all break free from the tyranny of rankings and metrics.
150480	153120	T, welcome to the podcast. Thanks so much for joining us.
153680	155360	Thank you. I'm happy to be here.
156080	159040	Today, we're talking about your latest book, The Score,
159040	160960	How to Stop Playing Someone Else's Game.
161760	164000	That's quite a provocative title, I'd say.
164640	167920	It's all about the notion of games and gamification.
168640	171120	First off, to get us all on the same page,
171680	176880	you hear the term bandied around a lot, but what exactly do we mean by gamification?
177680	184000	I started writing this book because I became obsessed with a question
184000	188800	that came up from two different streams of what I was thinking about.
188800	195920	One stream was about how games and scoring systems often lead to such delightful play,
196000	202240	and the other half was about how gamification's rankings and metrics,
202240	207120	my experience of them in education, institution, online, on social media,
207120	212560	seem to drain the life out of everything and ruin my experience of communication,
212560	216080	of education, of being a researcher, of being a person.
216080	217600	I wanted to understand that.
220160	222080	Gamification is a really complicated term.
222080	227520	The first thing to say about gamification is that gamification is taking the kind of
227520	233520	superficial trappings of a game, the leveling experience, the scoring experience,
233520	240080	the fact that you're getting points, and applying it to a non-game context,
240880	243280	applying it to work, applying it to education.
243920	246800	Underneath and more deep down, I think one way to put it,
246800	251040	and this is maybe my own quirky usage, is that games are things,
251040	254240	they're kind of artificial activities that you create and invent,
254240	256400	and to do that you use a scoring system.
256400	260400	And gamifications are taking something that we're actually already doing
260400	262400	with an actually extant goal, right?
262400	265360	We're already trying to learn things, we're already trying to get healthier,
265360	268560	we're already trying to increase our scientific product,
268560	273120	and then applying the appearance and mechanics of a scoring system
273120	278240	and slapping that onto a real-life activity, and I think substantively transforming it.
278800	283520	Yeah, so let's start with scoring systems, and I think while it might not necessarily always
283520	287600	be in the forefront of our minds, if we stop and think for just a few seconds,
288240	292720	scoring systems or ranking systems are everywhere, grades at school, sports leagues,
292720	296720	movie reviews, and even in things like artistic pursuits.
296720	302080	So I play classical guitar, and I've forgotten the amount of times I've played a piece for somebody,
302080	303440	and the first thing they say is,
303680	305760	Oof, that looks tricky, what grade is it?
305760	308000	You know, they want to know what level it's at.
308000	311040	It's really, really interesting, isn't it? Like psychologically.
311040	315680	So first off, is there a sort of quick and dirty definition of what a scoring system is?
315680	317600	You know, how can we define it?
317600	322320	A scoring system, I think it's a particular kind of social technology.
322320	323840	It's a way of doing things.
323840	325360	I worked some in the philosophy of technology,
325360	328080	and I have a really broad definition of a technology.
328080	329920	A technology is a way of doing things.
330000	334720	Sometimes it's material, but sometimes it's like an idea or a way of organizing an institution.
334720	337680	Like for a lot of people in the space, like the idea of a factory,
337680	340640	the idea of an assembly line is a kind of technology.
340640	343120	It's a new way of doing things that changes the world.
343120	345440	I think the scoring system is something similar.
345440	347840	A scoring system is a social technology.
347840	351840	It's a method for guaranteeing a convergence of judgments.
352400	358800	It's some way of specifying in an official way how we're going to judge things so we all get on board.
358800	361920	And I think one thing, so the book we're talking about,
361920	364000	it's my first popular book, but it's my second book.
364000	367360	My first book was an academic book about games.
367360	370160	And that first book, one of the things I really wanted to talk about
370160	373440	was the beauty of games as this designed art form
373440	375840	that weren't just stories or narratives or worlds,
376480	380400	but were specifying alternate selves.
380400	382960	So I was really inspired while I was reading this stuff
382960	386400	by a lecture at the Game Developers Conference
386400	388960	by Reiner Knizia, who's my favorite board game designer.
388960	392240	He's a German genius of board game design.
392240	395280	And he says in this moment that the scoring system
396400	400080	is the most important design tool in his toolbox
400080	402400	because it tells the players what to care about.
402400	404000	It sets their motivations in the game.
404000	406240	Like you open up a game, you open up a board game,
406240	408160	and you find out what you're trying to do.
408160	412720	You find out whether your cares are going to be aligned with other people
412720	415520	or aligned with team or whether you're completely individualistic.
415520	418000	You find out whether you're getting points for killing people
418000	419680	or collecting resources, right?
419680	421040	They tell you what to do.
421680	425120	But one thing I missed, and I kind of can't believe I missed it,
425760	428240	I think it's because I was obsessed with board games
428800	430480	when I was writing the first book.
430480	433200	I thought that every game had to have a scoring system.
433760	435520	And now I realize that they don't.
435520	437840	And it's actually really valuable to look at the difference
437840	440080	between unscored and scored games.
440080	443600	So there are a lot of games and a lot of even competitive games
443600	445040	that don't have a scoring system.
445040	446640	And a lot of these look like aesthetic games.
446640	449040	So my favorite example is like skateboarding.
449040	453280	When people go to the skate park, I'm not a skateboarder.
453280	455440	I'm a rock climber, I'm a fisher, but I'm not a skateboarder.
455440	457200	So all of this is secondhand knowledge.
457200	460960	They're often, they are competing and they're competing for cool.
460960	463920	By the way, I should confess, in my first draft of this book,
463920	467760	I said that skateboarders were competing for the coolest trick.
467760	472080	And a 20 something year old editor, Penguin, who's a skateboarder,
472080	473440	she wrote me a note and said,
473440	476640	you sound old and out of touch with her misdeeds.
476640	478480	It turned out to mean stylish ease, which I love.
478480	480160	I didn't know. I feel like a poser saying this.
480160	483920	But like, so there's often an aesthetic competition
483920	488960	and you don't have a pre-established way of figuring out who won.
488960	491360	And in fact, you can go and come out with a,
491360	493040	A, you don't need to have a single conclusion.
493040	494720	You can be like, oh, I wanted to skate park
494720	496240	and this person did the most explosive trick
496240	497840	and this person did the most beautiful trick.
497840	500240	That's fine. You don't need to see a single conclusion.
500240	502160	And you also don't need a bunch of people
502720	504400	to come to the same conclusion, right?
504400	506560	You can have the competition, right?
506560	508240	I mean, I think in a very casual sense,
508240	509760	if you're sitting around your friends
509760	513040	and like casually competing to tell the funniest joke,
513040	516240	it's clear that it's a competition and it's clear that it's a game,
516240	519840	but you don't need a method to settle who won officially.
520720	522000	And you see these transitions.
522720	525280	There's a transition in skateboarding
526000	527520	when skateboarding went official,
527520	529600	when it went to ESPNX games and the Olympics.
531040	533840	They needed a clearer way to produce something
533840	535760	that looked like an objective score.
535760	538240	And so the practice shifted
538240	540880	from a kind of more aesthetic, stylish practice
540880	546640	to one centered on more mechanistic, easier to measure,
546640	552640	easier to publicly validate goals, height, and number of flips.
552640	555680	The entire practice shifted in order to make it easy
555680	557920	for everyone to agree on the same judgment.
557920	561520	And I think in some sense, what this book is about
561520	563680	is worrying on the smaller scale.
563680	566000	Maybe this kind of scoring system change
566000	568480	robs us of something in skateboarding, maybe.
569200	571120	But I'm worried about this in the large scale
571120	574000	that this is happening everywhere, globally,
574000	577840	that we are shifting consistently from subtler, richer,
577840	583120	but still real targets to easier to measure, easier to count,
583120	585200	easier to agree on targets,
585200	587280	and that this is shifting what we care about.
587280	589760	Part of what I say in the book is that the thing that
589760	591840	I'm really worried about is what I'm calling the gap.
591840	596480	And the gap is the distance between what actually matters
597440	602880	and what's easy to measure and easy to count in a public manner.
602880	603840	And those aren't the same.
603840	605200	And I think it's really easy to think.
605200	607840	I mean, I don't know how technical you want to get,
607840	610240	but one way for me to put it is it's really easy
610240	612480	for us to make this slide into thinking
612480	615520	that what's easy to count together is all that's real.
615520	616880	It's all that's objective.
617680	620480	Actually, no, there are plenty of things that are real
620480	622800	and really important, that are very subtle
622800	624880	and require a lot of experience to understand.
625680	630960	But the demand of scoring systems that we count in unison easily,
630960	633680	that the counting rules be accessible to everyone
633680	635280	and that everyone can count in the same way,
635920	640160	they shift what we target in a profound and systematic way.
640960	643120	Yeah, so in the book, you write something
643120	644400	that I thought was really fascinating,
644400	646880	something that I've actually thought myself
647360	648400	that's fly fishing.
648400	650400	I've never actually been fly fishing myself,
650400	652960	but when I was younger, I was a keen course angler.
653680	655760	I often go with my dad and my twin.
655760	659840	And of course, you naturally enter into a competition
659840	662560	without even trying to, who can catch the biggest fish,
662560	666080	who can catch the most different species or whatever.
666080	669680	But if you were to ask me now, 20, well, blind me,
669680	672640	30 odd years later, what do I remember from that?
672640	674800	I don't remember the day that I caught the most fish.
674800	676960	I don't remember the biggest fish that I caught.
676960	680960	I just remember spending time with my family outdoors,
680960	682320	having a really good time.
683040	685920	So in the book, you have a sentence
685920	689360	that while catching fish may be the goal of fishing,
689360	690640	it's not the purpose.
691280	693280	And I think that's a really key point.
693280	695600	So can you unpack that idea for us, please?
695600	697760	Yeah, this is one of the central ideas, I think.
697760	701040	And one of the things why, I know some people think it's weird
701040	703680	that I'm a philosopher and I think a lot about games.
703680	707040	I think games teach us something really important about,
707600	709280	I mean, maybe this sounds pretentious,
709280	710480	but the meaning of life.
710480	713360	And it's there in what you just said.
713360	716000	I started thinking about this because I think a moment,
716000	719680	I was in graduate school and my mentor, Barbara Herman,
719680	722480	the esteemed Kantian ethicist who terrified everyone,
722480	723600	she was saying something.
723600	725200	And all the graduate students are always trying
725200	726400	to catch out the professors.
726400	728240	And we were like, oh, that doesn't make sense.
728240	730560	And we tried to, I can't even remember what the point was.
730560	733520	And she was like, oh, you're all making a mistake.
733520	736160	You're just failing to distinguish between a goal
736160	737040	and a purpose.
737040	738720	And all those were like, ah, there's no such thing
738720	739280	as a difference.
739280	740400	And those are the same thing.
740400	742960	And she says, no, when you invite your friends over
743520	746800	for a night of cards, the goal is to win,
746800	748400	but the purpose is to have fun.
749200	751200	And these are really different, right?
751200	753760	I think one way to put it is that the goal of a game
753760	755920	is what you formally pursue in the game.
755920	757440	It's the stated goal of the game.
757440	758720	It's the victory condition.
758720	760800	And the purpose is why you play.
760800	762480	And there are different reasons to play.
762480	765120	For some people, I call them achievement players.
765840	768560	Some people play the game in order to win.
768560	770000	That's the value for them, right?
770000	771600	Either because it gets them something they want,
771600	773680	like status or money, or because they just want to win.
773680	774640	That's achievement play.
775840	778720	Another kind of player is a striving player.
779600	785520	And a striving player is somebody who tries to win
786480	790720	in order to have a process of interesting or beautiful
790720	792320	or satisfying struggle.
792320	794320	What they care about is the struggle.
794320	796560	And the interesting thing for me about games
796560	799120	is that in the posture of striving play,
799840	801920	what you care about is the process,
801920	805840	but you can't get that process without trying to win.
805840	808000	One of the interesting things for me about fly fishing
808000	810160	is I find it very meditative, actually.
810160	812960	I'm out in Utah, and I know a lot of dudes
812960	816320	that have this very intense relationship to fly fishing.
816320	819520	And my theory is that what they actually need is meditation,
819520	823840	but they're too doodly to actually do that explicitly.
824480	826480	But fly fishing is like cover, right?
826480	827600	You're like, oh, I'm fly fishing.
827600	829280	But it can't just be like a superficial cover.
829280	831200	You just can't go pretend to yourself
831200	832880	and then go out there and try to meditate.
832880	836240	The whole point is that meditation doesn't happen
836240	837520	when you aim at meditating.
837520	839840	Meditating happens for me on the river
839840	841840	when I'm trying to catch fish,
841840	844080	which means I'm trying to look at my surroundings
844080	845520	to find signs of fish.
845520	848880	And so that goal forces me to pay much more attention
848880	851440	than I would ever pay to the fine details
851440	852560	of the surface of the water.
853360	858640	And then I achieve meditation, kind of accidentally.
858640	861360	There's a philosophy term for this, a self-effacing end.
861360	864240	A self-effacing end is an end you can't aim at directly.
864240	866480	My favorite version of this is relaxation.
867360	869760	You can't relax just by being like, I'm going to relax.
869760	872000	You can't relax by trying harder to relax.
872000	874320	I relax by trying to climb rocks.
874320	876720	So there's a place where the goal is to go up,
876720	880400	but the purpose is to cleanse my mind and relax.

948880	951040	So sort of running through the book as well,
951040	953520	that's sort of veering over the whole thing
953520	956720	is perhaps the evil sibling of the story,
956720	958000	if I can call it that.
958000	959200	And that's metrics.
960560	962000	So what do we mean by metric?
962640	963520	What is a metric?
964080	966000	A metric, one way to put it is a metric
966000	968800	is a scoring system for reality, right?
968800	970960	A game is a scoring system imposed
970960	973200	on an artificial separate universe.
973200	975920	It's this old idea that games happen in a magic circle
975920	978080	and you go in and you try to, you know,
978080	980000	destroy your spouse and then you step back and you're like,
980000	981120	ah, everything's fine again.
982000	986320	Metrics are what happens when you use quantitative data
987280	990160	about the real world and you transform that
990160	991920	into a target or a scoring system.
991920	994880	It's when you target something that can be easily measured.
995680	996640	In the game's half of the book,
996640	998720	the core concept is striving play, which we've talked about.
999520	1001440	On the metric side, the core concept for me
1001440	1003200	is the idea of value capture.
1003840	1009200	Value capture is what happens when your values
1009200	1010800	are kind of rich and subtle
1011360	1013440	and then you enter an institution or a social setting
1013440	1014720	that feeds you simplified,
1014720	1017200	typically quantified renditions of those values
1017200	1018880	and the simplified ones take over.
1018880	1022640	So for me, it was going to philosophy graduate school
1022640	1024000	out of a love of philosophy
1024000	1026560	and then coming out obsessed with citation rates
1026560	1028160	in highly ranked journals.
1028160	1029680	For a lot of scientists I know,
1029680	1030960	they go into the love of wisdom
1030960	1033040	and they come out obsessed with like grant numbers
1033040	1034880	and how big your grants are.
1034880	1037440	For journalists, it becomes page views.
1037440	1039040	For a lot of us on social media,
1039040	1041440	you start wanting communication
1041440	1044160	and you start ending up wanting likes.
1044160	1047200	And so the important thing for me about a metric
1047200	1049280	is that a metric presents you a target
1049280	1050560	and a target that's limited
1050560	1052160	in the way we talked about before.
1052160	1054480	It's limited because of the need
1054480	1056160	for everyone to count together.
1056160	1058400	So it's limited to touching on the kind of features
1058400	1061760	that everyone can count easily, height, number of flips.
1061760	1065440	And then if what's actually valuable
1066160	1068000	is not what's easily counted,
1068000	1072800	then value capture will tend to push your values away
1073840	1075280	from what actually matters.
1075280	1077920	By the way, maybe this will entertain you.
1077920	1081920	I have a favorite example of this in normal life
1081920	1083200	that got cut from the book
1083200	1085840	because it seemed gross,
1085840	1087920	but I think you'll find it interesting.
1087920	1089440	So while I was reading this,
1089440	1092480	I started researching pickup artist culture.
1093200	1095120	And interestingly, pickup artists
1095120	1096080	have been really well studied
1096080	1098160	by sociologists and anthropologists.
1098160	1099920	There's a sociologist, Eric Hendricks,
1099920	1102000	who embedded with pickup artists for a while.
1102000	1103520	So pickup artist culture is people,
1103520	1104720	mostly but not always men,
1104720	1106720	who compete for sexual success.
1106720	1110560	And one of the interesting things that he discovered
1111120	1114960	was that pickup artists are uninterested in happiness.
1114960	1116400	In fact, one of the standard mottoes is
1116400	1117920	you have to sacrifice any interest
1117920	1120080	in happiness or pleasure in order to win.
1120640	1122320	So what pickup artists typically compete for,
1122320	1124320	and I think this is like one of my favorite examples,
1124320	1127760	is number of phone numbers you get in the night,
1127760	1130080	number of sexual acts you get in a month,
1130080	1131440	speed from meeting someone
1131440	1133600	to some kind of sexual interaction.
1133600	1134880	Here's what they don't compete for,
1135600	1138000	romance, quality relationships,
1138000	1139680	or even pleasure, right?
1139680	1141920	This is one of the things that blew my mind.
1141920	1145520	I thought pickup artists would be evil,
1146560	1149200	but at least enjoys themselves.
1149200	1150640	But I think something else has happened
1150640	1151920	that's even worse.
1151920	1153280	And hopefully it's clear.
1153280	1157120	The whole point is that pickup artistry
1157680	1161120	has shifted the need for competition
1161120	1162960	and accountability about your competition
1163680	1165920	and transparency about your wins
1165920	1168560	has led to a shift of the behavior
1168560	1171440	towards targeting things that are so far,
1171440	1172400	at least for me,
1172400	1174800	from what most of us would think is valuable
1174800	1176240	in a romantic relationship,
1176240	1178000	even a short-term one.
1178000	1180560	And that's an example of value capture,
1180560	1183920	where they've sacrificed any amount of pleasure
1183920	1186800	or happiness purely just for essentially,
1187120	1188080	for a number.
1188080	1189200	Bragging rights, I suppose,
1189200	1192240	they can say, you're 10, I'm 12,
1192240	1193920	I'm better than you sort of thing.
1193920	1194640	Exactly.
1194640	1196880	And this is the part where I want to caution,
1196880	1197520	and I want to be like,
1197520	1200080	it's really easy to point at other people and laugh,
1200080	1202400	but I think it's very easy
1202400	1205280	to find value capture cases in your own life.
1205280	1208480	I've been value captured by the quest for lower weight,
1208480	1211760	the quest for optimizing my macronutrients,
1211760	1214400	the quest to get higher on the philosophy rankings.
1215120	1217600	Each of these things has for some period of time
1217600	1220080	consumed me, and it's really wild
1220080	1223200	because it's so miserable a lot of the times.
1225840	1227600	The thing that I find really fascinating
1227600	1229600	is how easy it is to lose your grip
1229600	1230800	on what really matters
1230800	1233200	when you're presented with a simple, clear number,
1233200	1234720	both institutionally,
1234720	1236800	like in my academic life,
1236800	1239360	I'm in large-scale institutions that have,
1239360	1242000	to my mind, stopped targeting things
1242000	1244560	like teaching curiosity, teaching reflection,
1244560	1246320	teaching any kind of intellectual virtue,
1246320	1247520	and started targeting things
1247520	1250080	like graduation rate and graduation speed.
1250080	1253440	Again, easy measurables that capture people's attention
1254000	1257120	because they are easy to express.
1257840	1260240	Yeah, so I think you mentioned there
1260240	1263040	one, as you say, slightly gross example,
1263040	1264480	and then a more serious one,
1264480	1266960	but the first thing that perhaps came to my mind
1266960	1268160	when I was thinking about this
1268160	1270720	is where the emphasis is placed
1270720	1272880	on the incorrect metric
1272880	1274720	would be something like GP appointments.
1274720	1276320	Like there's a lot of talk about this
1276320	1277840	at the moment over here in the UK,
1278560	1282400	and you can reach a point where sort of GP practices,
1282400	1284240	let's say hypothetically,
1284240	1286720	we're rating these practices
1286720	1288480	on the number of patients that they're seeing.
1289120	1290640	So if we're concentrating on that,
1290640	1292160	obviously what we're going to do
1292880	1294480	is reduce the appointment time
1294480	1296480	so we can fit in more appointments per day.
1297120	1300160	And the only logical conclusion to that
1300720	1303520	to me seems that the quality of care is going to go down.
1304080	1307920	But if we're using this metric to rate them on,
1307920	1311120	it will go up while the quality,
1311120	1312320	the sort of rating goes up,
1312320	1314320	while the quality of care goes down.
1314320	1318000	So is that the kind of example that you're talking about?
1318000	1320800	Right, that's exactly the kind of example I'm talking about.
1320800	1323040	Actually, that example is a great one.
1323040	1324400	I think whenever I talk about this stuff,
1324400	1325120	everyone wants to tell me
1325120	1326640	about the terrible metric in their life,
1326640	1329120	but I think it's actually more unnerving
1329200	1331040	for me to think about subtler examples.
1331040	1332560	I think it's going to be really obvious.
1333280	1335920	I mean, so I'm a professor.
1335920	1337280	I'm rated on student evaluations.
1337280	1338960	We all know the way to get high student evaluations
1338960	1340560	is to make an easy class.
1340560	1341840	Students don't learn as much,
1341840	1343360	but you get higher evaluations.
1343920	1347840	Lousy metrics are really, really obvious.
1347840	1350960	I think some of the most nauseating cases for me
1350960	1352720	are cases where the metrics are pretty good,
1353840	1354960	but imperfect.
1354960	1357200	And the one that this is perhaps
1357200	1359200	a politically dangerous view,
1359200	1362160	but a worrisome one for me that I've been obsessed with
1362160	1364400	since the COVID pandemic is the degree
1364400	1366960	to which easy public health metrics
1366960	1370560	like lives saved and life expectancy
1371440	1373840	tend to trump other considerations
1373840	1376160	like life quality, cultural quality,
1376160	1377840	community, mental health.
1378480	1382160	And I'm not saying that it's not important to save lives,
1382960	1386000	but I'm saying maybe a less controversial example for me
1386000	1389200	is like saturated fats, like cheese, right?
1389200	1393520	It's very easy to track heart attack rates,
1393520	1396880	longer lifespans, very hard to track culinary joy.
1397440	1399120	The claim here isn't anti-scientific.
1399120	1401200	There is a genuine real correlation
1401200	1403280	between saturated fats and heart attack rates.
1403280	1405440	The claim is certain kinds of things
1405440	1408080	that are easier to measure tend to beat out automatically
1408080	1410960	and unthinkingly other harder to measure values.
1411680	1412800	And try to understand this.
1412800	1415280	So there's one common response here,
1415280	1416800	which is, oh, that's just a bad metric.
1416800	1418560	We need to find better metrics.
1418560	1420320	And I had this gut, a lot of the time
1420320	1421040	when I was thinking about this,
1421040	1423840	I had this gut response that you wouldn't be able
1423840	1426640	to find better metrics for certain kinds of things,
1426640	1428480	especially central human values.
1428480	1429760	And I was trying to understand why.
1429760	1431520	And I found some answers,
1431520	1434560	especially from some philosophers like Elizabeth Barnes
1434560	1436000	who works on the notion of health
1436000	1437440	and then a bunch of historians
1437440	1439920	in a field called science and technology studies.
1440480	1442960	So Theodore Porter unlocked a huge amount
1442960	1443680	of this stuff for me.
1443680	1446880	And this is a thing I am literally dying to talk about
1446880	1448480	on the BBC science podcast.
1448480	1449680	Because this, okay.
1450480	1452480	So Theodore Porter was a historian
1452480	1454880	who was inspired by actually by a bunch of philosophers
1454880	1457520	I have to claim like Ian Hacking and Bruno Latour.
1457520	1461360	And he was really interested in why politicians
1461360	1463760	and administrators tended to unthinking
1463760	1467440	kind of automatically reach for quantitative justification,
1467440	1469040	even when the metrics were bad.
1470080	1472640	So the theory he developed was that
1472640	1475200	there were two kinds of ways of knowing about the world,
1475200	1476640	qualitative and quantitative.
1477440	1479920	And it's not that quantitative is bad.
1479920	1481760	It's that each of them is a tool designed
1481760	1483120	for a different purpose
1483120	1485040	with different strengths and weaknesses.
1485040	1486560	And the problem is compulsively reaching
1486560	1487440	for the quantitative.
1488000	1491200	So qualitative justification, written words,
1491200	1493760	is open-ended, dynamic, subtle, rich,
1493760	1496320	but it travels badly between contexts
1496320	1498720	because it requires a huge amount of shared background.
1499600	1502000	So one way for me, my example is as a professor,
1502000	1504800	when I write qualitative evaluations of my students,
1504800	1506960	I can respond along multiple dimensions.
1506960	1509360	I don't have to declare a single overall score.
1509360	1510640	I can be like, well, you're really creative,
1510640	1511440	but it wasn't as rigorous.
1511440	1512640	I didn't have to settle that up.
1512640	1514880	And I can also use all the rich language,
1514880	1516480	a philosophy of my class.
1517360	1520480	But one, those things don't travel well.
1520480	1521840	Like people from the business school
1521840	1522960	will not understand my comments
1522960	1525360	and I won't understand their student comments.
1525360	1527280	And two, they do not aggregate well.
1527280	1531040	Like thousands of student evaluations don't aggregate.
1531920	1536720	So what Porter says is quantitative information
1536720	1538880	is a kind of instrument that's designed
1538880	1540640	to get around this problem.
1540640	1543600	When we create quantitative information in an institution,
1544480	1547440	we identify a context-invariant kernel.
1547440	1550640	We find something that's stable across all contexts,
1550640	1553360	that everyone from different backgrounds can understand.
1553360	1555440	We agree on it, we rigidify it,
1555440	1559280	and then we can all understand and connect and collect into it.
1559280	1561600	So in the US, this is GPA, grade point average.
1561600	1563120	If you get an A, that's a four.
1563120	1564400	If you get a B, that's a three.
1565040	1568640	Every student work can be pushed into a single spectrum
1568640	1570160	that can be quickly averaged
1570160	1571440	and get a grade point average.
1572240	1578240	So Porter's insight is that data has been designed to travel.
1578240	1579760	His term is that it's portable.
1579760	1581760	It's been made to be portable.
1581760	1584000	And the way it's made to be portable
1584000	1587440	is it has context and subtlety stripped out.
1588400	1591040	It's been designed to be understood across contexts.
1591760	1594640	So I think the thing that Porter identifies for me
1594640	1596720	is that the kind of what I would call
1596720	1599360	the insensitivity and inhumanity of metrics
1599360	1600800	is an essential design feature.
1601680	1604320	In order to communicate readily at scale,
1604320	1606800	we have to strip off things that require
1606800	1608640	high context and nuance to understand.
1609600	1613120	So the thing that makes metrics powerful,
1613120	1615920	that is the quick aggregation, the easy comprehensibility,
1616000	1621120	is achieved precisely at the cost of loss of nuance.
1621120	1622800	And I'm not saying this is bad in every case.
1622800	1624880	Like this is also, this is not just metrics.
1624880	1626000	This is science, right?
1626000	1628960	The reason why it's really easy to optimize
1628960	1631440	for certain things like antibiotics
1631440	1633680	is that having an antibiotic stop your infection
1633680	1635680	is really easy for everyone to see.
1635680	1638080	Having a lifesaving measure save on someone's life,
1638080	1639360	that's easy to count.
1639360	1640480	So those are the kinds of things
1640480	1642720	that are very easy to collect large scale data for.
1643680	1647040	Things that are highly variable require high sensitivity
1647040	1648880	or that are subtle are very hard.
1648880	1651360	And this is not saying they're not real, right?
1651920	1654000	It's just saying that they're hard for everyone
1654000	1656080	to assess quickly and easily.
1656880	1659120	One of my favorite examples of here is like,
1659120	1663120	so there are a lot of legal rights that we connect to age.
1664160	1667120	And what we actually don't, we don't actually care about age.
1667120	1668320	What we actually care about is intellectual
1668320	1672480	and emotional maturity, but it would be a disaster
1672560	1675440	if we granted voting rights based on intellectual
1675440	1676480	and emotional maturity, right?
1676480	1678080	You would need a particular judge.
1678080	1680880	So there's a case where we make a trade-off
1680880	1683280	and instead of exactly tracking the thing,
1683280	1685920	we find a mechanical line in the U.S.
1685920	1687760	You get to vote if you're 18, right?
1688480	1690400	And that mechanical line is inarguable.
1690400	1692320	Everyone assesses it at the same place.
1692320	1694000	And that's a case where I think it's great.
1694000	1695840	It is fantastic that for voting,
1695840	1698240	we have a clear mechanical line that everyone can replicate.
1699120	1701600	But for other things, like, I don't know,
1701600	1706000	choosing your arts grants or choosing your fitness routine
1706000	1708000	or choosing what your career is.
1708960	1712480	These things, it's less important that our decision procedure
1712480	1715920	and our targeting procedure are bound by the standard
1715920	1721600	of absolute context-crossing decontextualization.
1721600	1725520	I mean, the quick way to put it is that for Porter,
1726480	1732080	data and therefore metrics are a designed engineer technology
1732080	1736400	that gets us fast, portable aggregability
1736400	1737520	at the cost of context.
1738400	1743440	Yeah, so another thing that you talk about is the appeal of metrics.
1743440	1746640	And I don't think it's just their tidiness.
1746640	1748480	It's kind of the kind of authority
1748480	1750000	that they seem to carry within them.
1750000	1753280	You know, that's the final verdict on this issue.
1753360	1756080	This such and such is five out of 10.
1756080	1758800	That's it, you know, and so we're kind of,
1758800	1760640	do you think we're less likely to challenge that
1760640	1763600	because it seems like it is so black and white?
1763600	1767760	Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of, this has been this puzzle for me
1767760	1770480	for the longest time of why these things are so seductive.
1771120	1773520	One of the early explanations I had was that
1773520	1775760	there's this kind of like existential soothingness,
1775760	1779520	like it's really painful to be exposed to the complexity of real values
1779520	1780800	and this makes things easy.
1780800	1782000	That's one explanation.
1782000	1785280	Another explanation is that it's just easier to communicate.
1785280	1786240	And Porter tells us why.
1786240	1787920	It's been designed to be easier to communicate.
1788800	1791440	Lately, I've been thinking, I even came up with a term for it
1791440	1793760	literally yesterday in my graduate seminar,
1793760	1795280	talking to my students about this.
1795280	1798400	A lot of the times, the way we say that something is objective
1798400	1802240	versus subjective is that we get someone else's confirmation.
1802240	1804400	They see it too, right?
1804400	1807440	That is literally the basic, if you go back to like
1807440	1811600	old Hume classics of empiricist philosophy,
1812400	1816640	you know that the feeling of warmth is subjective
1816640	1819200	because different people experience it differently in the same place
1819200	1821280	and you know that temperature is objective
1821280	1824240	because different people will come up with the same measurement, right?
1824240	1828560	But I kind of think metrics do a kind of objectivity hacking, right?
1828560	1833520	They create a quick, easy shortcut to agreement and convergence
1834320	1838960	by zeroing in on features that are highly accessible.
1839760	1845280	And so this is, I feel like we're headed into like weirdo technical philosophy,
1845280	1847200	but the thing that's really interesting to me
1847200	1851360	is the difference between what's real and what's important
1852080	1854880	and what's easily observable by anybody,
1854880	1857520	especially under conditions of quickness and speed.
1858480	1864800	And metrics are designed to create easy convergence at speed among everybody.
1864800	1867280	They're a shortcut to the appearance of objectivity.
1868240	1870560	So we've talked about quite a lot there,
1870560	1873440	a lot of different pitfalls that are in this.
1873440	1876960	So sort of for someone who's listening, he's thinking, you know,
1876960	1881520	how can they avoid falling foul of these pitfalls?
1881520	1884240	You know, what can we learn from games?
1884240	1888640	And you talk about the notion of play, which is really interesting,
1888640	1891600	that we can actually apply in our own lives,
1891600	1893600	because often it can feel like a lot of these things
1893600	1895440	are just completely out of our own control.
1896080	1900400	Yeah, I mean, not only A, a lot of these systems are out of our control
1900400	1902640	and a lot of the fixes here are structural.
1902640	1906320	I'm not going to sit here and say like, we can fix this through individual grit.
1906320	1908720	Like a lot of this is because of the way the institutions work.
1909520	1913840	Even there, you can find different relationships to external scoring systems.
1914720	1918480	And it's important to remember that we do use them all the time.
1918480	1922720	Even I think even the best relationship to scoring systems in the world
1922720	1925600	is going to constantly use them because scoring systems
1925600	1929040	are a response to real needs to understand other people,
1930240	1936000	to make them transparent to us, to get information quickly.
1936000	1940400	Like I use rankings when I buy household gadgets.
1940400	1942560	I don't have the time to research every dishwasher.
1942560	1943760	I use rankings, right?
1943760	1945760	They're summarized compressed information.
1946320	1950000	What you want to do is realize that they're highly lossy,
1950560	1954800	highly information devoid, highly thin packages
1955680	1959200	that are useful, maybe a starting point that are not complete.
1959840	1964480	And I think games offer us a really good glimpse of what we can do
1964480	1967280	because I think the life that games,
1967280	1968960	it's not that they automatically give this to you,
1968960	1972080	but the life they encourage is a life in which
1972080	1975520	you enter scoring systems voluntarily
1976080	1979360	and you choose which ones you want to have
1980080	1982640	and you can modify them, right?
1982640	1984720	Like the difference in games, I mean, this is,
1984720	1987120	and this is in many ways, it's a structural difference, right?
1987120	1992480	You can house rule your poker game or your Dungeons and Dragons game.
1992480	1995200	You can't house rule GPA because of the way that metrics function.
1995840	1998640	But the closest you can approximate to that is something like,
1999360	2002640	I think games encourage something that I want to call reflective control.
2002640	2005520	So games encourage trying a scoring system
2005520	2009600	and then not just assuming that we have to play this particular board game forever,
2009600	2012480	but thinking afterwards, was it worth it?
2012480	2013120	Was it fun?
2013120	2015840	And what you're doing is transitioning between
2015840	2018240	being absorbed in a particular game goal
2018240	2020480	and reflecting more deeply on its purpose
2020480	2022880	and whether that purpose was rich or meaningful to you.
2022880	2024880	And you can just decide, now that game sucked,
2024880	2025760	I'm not going to play it again.
2025760	2028000	Or that game was kind of good, but I'm going to modify it.
2028000	2031680	You have some degree of control and games make that easy
2031680	2033680	because there are so many and they're so disconnected.
2034400	2035520	I think that's the right attitude.
2035520	2037120	It's much harder to apply in the world
2037120	2041520	because you don't have these isolated, easily movable between packages
2041520	2042320	like you do with games.
2042320	2044800	You get these massive world-spanning systems.
2044800	2049200	But still, there's a difference between treating your subscriber count
2049200	2053200	or your likes or your page views as a rough proxy
2053200	2054800	that gives you some information
2054800	2057360	versus treating it, taking on as your core value.
2058960	2061680	I think one crucial part of that is,
2062480	2063920	if you take it on as your core value,
2063920	2066320	you don't have a standpoint from which to reflect
2066320	2067760	on whether it's working out for you.
2067760	2069920	If you think the point of your life is just to make the most money
2069920	2072880	or get the most followers, then that's it.
2072880	2074240	That's just what you're doing.
2074240	2075520	But if you're thinking to yourself,
2075520	2079120	I'm trying to get followers in order to communicate
2079120	2082320	and connect with people, then you have a stance
2082320	2085040	from which you can limit your devotion to that simple metric.

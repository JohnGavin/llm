Hello and welcome to Incident Genius, a bite-sized masterclass in podcast form.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.200
Every Monday and Friday, you'll hear world-leading scientists and experts

01:23.200 --> 01:26.560
talking about the most fascinating ideas in science and technology today.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.320
I'm Jason Goodger, Commissioning Editor at BBC Science Focus.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.640
In the world of games, scoring systems establish a framework

01:34.640 --> 01:37.600
that provides us with clear challenges, motivation

01:37.600 --> 01:41.040
and ultimately delivers a huge amount of fun and pleasure.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.000
However, on the flip side, the increasing tendency to apply rankings and metrics

01:46.000 --> 01:49.200
to almost every area of our personal and professional lives

01:49.200 --> 01:52.640
can have a dehumanising effect, reducing our actions,

01:52.640 --> 01:56.240
performance and even ourselves to a simple string of numbers.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.880
In today's episode, we're joined by C.T. Nguyen, a games researcher

02:00.880 --> 02:04.480
and associate professor of philosophy based at the University of Utah,

02:04.480 --> 02:09.360
to talk about his latest book, The Score, How to Stop Playing Someone Else's Game.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.800
He explains how in the real world, scoring systems typically fail to provide meaning

02:14.800 --> 02:17.200
by focusing on the simplest to measure outcomes.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.160
How purely numerical data is, by definition, lacking in nuance.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.520
How, by concentrating on what we truly value,

02:25.520 --> 02:28.640
we can all break free from the tyranny of rankings and metrics.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.120
T, welcome to the podcast. Thanks so much for joining us.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.360
Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.040
Today, we're talking about your latest book, The Score,

02:39.040 --> 02:40.960
How to Stop Playing Someone Else's Game.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.000
That's quite a provocative title, I'd say.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.920
It's all about the notion of games and gamification.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.120
First off, to get us all on the same page,

02:51.680 --> 02:56.880
you hear the term bandied around a lot, but what exactly do we mean by gamification?

02:57.680 --> 03:04.000
I started writing this book because I became obsessed with a question

03:04.000 --> 03:08.800
that came up from two different streams of what I was thinking about.

03:08.800 --> 03:15.920
One stream was about how games and scoring systems often lead to such delightful play,

03:16.000 --> 03:22.240
and the other half was about how gamification's rankings and metrics,

03:22.240 --> 03:27.120
my experience of them in education, institution, online, on social media,

03:27.120 --> 03:32.560
seem to drain the life out of everything and ruin my experience of communication,

03:32.560 --> 03:36.080
of education, of being a researcher, of being a person.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.600
I wanted to understand that.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.080
Gamification is a really complicated term.

03:42.080 --> 03:47.520
The first thing to say about gamification is that gamification is taking the kind of

03:47.520 --> 03:53.520
superficial trappings of a game, the leveling experience, the scoring experience,

03:53.520 --> 04:00.080
the fact that you're getting points, and applying it to a non-game context,

04:00.880 --> 04:03.280
applying it to work, applying it to education.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.800
Underneath and more deep down, I think one way to put it,

04:06.800 --> 04:11.040
and this is maybe my own quirky usage, is that games are things,

04:11.040 --> 04:14.240
they're kind of artificial activities that you create and invent,

04:14.240 --> 04:16.400
and to do that you use a scoring system.

04:16.400 --> 04:20.400
And gamifications are taking something that we're actually already doing

04:20.400 --> 04:22.400
with an actually extant goal, right?

04:22.400 --> 04:25.360
We're already trying to learn things, we're already trying to get healthier,

04:25.360 --> 04:28.560
we're already trying to increase our scientific product,

04:28.560 --> 04:33.120
and then applying the appearance and mechanics of a scoring system

04:33.120 --> 04:38.240
and slapping that onto a real-life activity, and I think substantively transforming it.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.520
Yeah, so let's start with scoring systems, and I think while it might not necessarily always

04:43.520 --> 04:47.600
be in the forefront of our minds, if we stop and think for just a few seconds,

04:48.240 --> 04:52.720
scoring systems or ranking systems are everywhere, grades at school, sports leagues,

04:52.720 --> 04:56.720
movie reviews, and even in things like artistic pursuits.

04:56.720 --> 05:02.080
So I play classical guitar, and I've forgotten the amount of times I've played a piece for somebody,

05:02.080 --> 05:03.440
and the first thing they say is,

05:03.680 --> 05:05.760
Oof, that looks tricky, what grade is it?

05:05.760 --> 05:08.000
You know, they want to know what level it's at.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.040
It's really, really interesting, isn't it? Like psychologically.

05:11.040 --> 05:15.680
So first off, is there a sort of quick and dirty definition of what a scoring system is?

05:15.680 --> 05:17.600
You know, how can we define it?

05:17.600 --> 05:22.320
A scoring system, I think it's a particular kind of social technology.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.840
It's a way of doing things.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.360
I worked some in the philosophy of technology,

05:25.360 --> 05:28.080
and I have a really broad definition of a technology.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.920
A technology is a way of doing things.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.720
Sometimes it's material, but sometimes it's like an idea or a way of organizing an institution.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.680
Like for a lot of people in the space, like the idea of a factory,

05:37.680 --> 05:40.640
the idea of an assembly line is a kind of technology.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.120
It's a new way of doing things that changes the world.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.440
I think the scoring system is something similar.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.840
A scoring system is a social technology.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.840
It's a method for guaranteeing a convergence of judgments.

05:52.400 --> 05:58.800
It's some way of specifying in an official way how we're going to judge things so we all get on board.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.920
And I think one thing, so the book we're talking about,

06:01.920 --> 06:04.000
it's my first popular book, but it's my second book.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.360
My first book was an academic book about games.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.160
And that first book, one of the things I really wanted to talk about

06:10.160 --> 06:13.440
was the beauty of games as this designed art form

06:13.440 --> 06:15.840
that weren't just stories or narratives or worlds,

06:16.480 --> 06:20.400
but were specifying alternate selves.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.960
So I was really inspired while I was reading this stuff

06:22.960 --> 06:26.400
by a lecture at the Game Developers Conference

06:26.400 --> 06:28.960
by Reiner Knizia, who's my favorite board game designer.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.240
He's a German genius of board game design.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.280
And he says in this moment that the scoring system

06:36.400 --> 06:40.080
is the most important design tool in his toolbox

06:40.080 --> 06:42.400
because it tells the players what to care about.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.000
It sets their motivations in the game.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.240
Like you open up a game, you open up a board game,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.160
and you find out what you're trying to do.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.720
You find out whether your cares are going to be aligned with other people

06:52.720 --> 06:55.520
or aligned with team or whether you're completely individualistic.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.000
You find out whether you're getting points for killing people

06:58.000 --> 06:59.680
or collecting resources, right?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.040
They tell you what to do.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.120
But one thing I missed, and I kind of can't believe I missed it,

07:05.760 --> 07:08.240
I think it's because I was obsessed with board games

07:08.800 --> 07:10.480
when I was writing the first book.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.200
I thought that every game had to have a scoring system.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.520
And now I realize that they don't.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.840
And it's actually really valuable to look at the difference

07:17.840 --> 07:20.080
between unscored and scored games.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.600
So there are a lot of games and a lot of even competitive games

07:23.600 --> 07:25.040
that don't have a scoring system.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.640
And a lot of these look like aesthetic games.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.040
So my favorite example is like skateboarding.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.280
When people go to the skate park, I'm not a skateboarder.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.440
I'm a rock climber, I'm a fisher, but I'm not a skateboarder.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.200
So all of this is secondhand knowledge.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.960
They're often, they are competing and they're competing for cool.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.920
By the way, I should confess, in my first draft of this book,

07:43.920 --> 07:47.760
I said that skateboarders were competing for the coolest trick.

07:47.760 --> 07:52.080
And a 20 something year old editor, Penguin, who's a skateboarder,

07:52.080 --> 07:53.440
she wrote me a note and said,

07:53.440 --> 07:56.640
you sound old and out of touch with her misdeeds.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.480
It turned out to mean stylish ease, which I love.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.160
I didn't know. I feel like a poser saying this.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.920
But like, so there's often an aesthetic competition

08:03.920 --> 08:08.960
and you don't have a pre-established way of figuring out who won.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.360
And in fact, you can go and come out with a,

08:11.360 --> 08:13.040
A, you don't need to have a single conclusion.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.720
You can be like, oh, I wanted to skate park

08:14.720 --> 08:16.240
and this person did the most explosive trick

08:16.240 --> 08:17.840
and this person did the most beautiful trick.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.240
That's fine. You don't need to see a single conclusion.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.160
And you also don't need a bunch of people

08:22.720 --> 08:24.400
to come to the same conclusion, right?

08:24.400 --> 08:26.560
You can have the competition, right?

08:26.560 --> 08:28.240
I mean, I think in a very casual sense,

08:28.240 --> 08:29.760
if you're sitting around your friends

08:29.760 --> 08:33.040
and like casually competing to tell the funniest joke,

08:33.040 --> 08:36.240
it's clear that it's a competition and it's clear that it's a game,

08:36.240 --> 08:39.840
but you don't need a method to settle who won officially.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.000
And you see these transitions.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.280
There's a transition in skateboarding

08:46.000 --> 08:47.520
when skateboarding went official,

08:47.520 --> 08:49.600
when it went to ESPNX games and the Olympics.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.840
They needed a clearer way to produce something

08:53.840 --> 08:55.760
that looked like an objective score.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.240
And so the practice shifted

08:58.240 --> 09:00.880
from a kind of more aesthetic, stylish practice

09:00.880 --> 09:06.640
to one centered on more mechanistic, easier to measure,

09:06.640 --> 09:12.640
easier to publicly validate goals, height, and number of flips.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.680
The entire practice shifted in order to make it easy

09:15.680 --> 09:17.920
for everyone to agree on the same judgment.

09:17.920 --> 09:21.520
And I think in some sense, what this book is about

09:21.520 --> 09:23.680
is worrying on the smaller scale.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.000
Maybe this kind of scoring system change

09:26.000 --> 09:28.480
robs us of something in skateboarding, maybe.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.120
But I'm worried about this in the large scale

09:31.120 --> 09:34.000
that this is happening everywhere, globally,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.840
that we are shifting consistently from subtler, richer,

09:37.840 --> 09:43.120
but still real targets to easier to measure, easier to count,

09:43.120 --> 09:45.200
easier to agree on targets,

09:45.200 --> 09:47.280
and that this is shifting what we care about.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.760
Part of what I say in the book is that the thing that

09:49.760 --> 09:51.840
I'm really worried about is what I'm calling the gap.

09:51.840 --> 09:56.480
And the gap is the distance between what actually matters

09:57.440 --> 10:02.880
and what's easy to measure and easy to count in a public manner.

10:02.880 --> 10:03.840
And those aren't the same.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.200
And I think it's really easy to think.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.840
I mean, I don't know how technical you want to get,

10:07.840 --> 10:10.240
but one way for me to put it is it's really easy

10:10.240 --> 10:12.480
for us to make this slide into thinking

10:12.480 --> 10:15.520
that what's easy to count together is all that's real.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.880
It's all that's objective.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.480
Actually, no, there are plenty of things that are real

10:20.480 --> 10:22.800
and really important, that are very subtle

10:22.800 --> 10:24.880
and require a lot of experience to understand.

10:25.680 --> 10:30.960
But the demand of scoring systems that we count in unison easily,

10:30.960 --> 10:33.680
that the counting rules be accessible to everyone

10:33.680 --> 10:35.280
and that everyone can count in the same way,

10:35.920 --> 10:40.160
they shift what we target in a profound and systematic way.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.120
Yeah, so in the book, you write something

10:43.120 --> 10:44.400
that I thought was really fascinating,

10:44.400 --> 10:46.880
something that I've actually thought myself

10:47.360 --> 10:48.400
that's fly fishing.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
I've never actually been fly fishing myself,

10:50.400 --> 10:52.960
but when I was younger, I was a keen course angler.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.760
I often go with my dad and my twin.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.840
And of course, you naturally enter into a competition

10:59.840 --> 11:02.560
without even trying to, who can catch the biggest fish,

11:02.560 --> 11:06.080
who can catch the most different species or whatever.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.680
But if you were to ask me now, 20, well, blind me,

11:09.680 --> 11:12.640
30 odd years later, what do I remember from that?

11:12.640 --> 11:14.800
I don't remember the day that I caught the most fish.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.960
I don't remember the biggest fish that I caught.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.960
I just remember spending time with my family outdoors,

11:20.960 --> 11:22.320
having a really good time.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.920
So in the book, you have a sentence

11:25.920 --> 11:29.360
that while catching fish may be the goal of fishing,

11:29.360 --> 11:30.640
it's not the purpose.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.280
And I think that's a really key point.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.600
So can you unpack that idea for us, please?

11:35.600 --> 11:37.760
Yeah, this is one of the central ideas, I think.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.040
And one of the things why, I know some people think it's weird

11:41.040 --> 11:43.680
that I'm a philosopher and I think a lot about games.

11:43.680 --> 11:47.040
I think games teach us something really important about,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.280
I mean, maybe this sounds pretentious,

11:49.280 --> 11:50.480
but the meaning of life.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.360
And it's there in what you just said.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.000
I started thinking about this because I think a moment,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.680
I was in graduate school and my mentor, Barbara Herman,

11:59.680 --> 12:02.480
the esteemed Kantian ethicist who terrified everyone,

12:02.480 --> 12:03.600
she was saying something.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.200
And all the graduate students are always trying

12:05.200 --> 12:06.400
to catch out the professors.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.240
And we were like, oh, that doesn't make sense.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.560
And we tried to, I can't even remember what the point was.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.520
And she was like, oh, you're all making a mistake.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.160
You're just failing to distinguish between a goal

12:16.160 --> 12:17.040
and a purpose.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.720
And all those were like, ah, there's no such thing

12:18.720 --> 12:19.280
as a difference.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.400
And those are the same thing.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.960
And she says, no, when you invite your friends over

12:23.520 --> 12:26.800
for a night of cards, the goal is to win,

12:26.800 --> 12:28.400
but the purpose is to have fun.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.200
And these are really different, right?

12:31.200 --> 12:33.760
I think one way to put it is that the goal of a game

12:33.760 --> 12:35.920
is what you formally pursue in the game.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.440
It's the stated goal of the game.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.720
It's the victory condition.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.800
And the purpose is why you play.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.480
And there are different reasons to play.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.120
For some people, I call them achievement players.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.560
Some people play the game in order to win.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.000
That's the value for them, right?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.600
Either because it gets them something they want,

12:51.600 --> 12:53.680
like status or money, or because they just want to win.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.640
That's achievement play.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.720
Another kind of player is a striving player.

12:59.600 --> 13:05.520
And a striving player is somebody who tries to win

13:06.480 --> 13:10.720
in order to have a process of interesting or beautiful

13:10.720 --> 13:12.320
or satisfying struggle.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.320
What they care about is the struggle.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.560
And the interesting thing for me about games

13:16.560 --> 13:19.120
is that in the posture of striving play,

13:19.840 --> 13:21.920
what you care about is the process,

13:21.920 --> 13:25.840
but you can't get that process without trying to win.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.000
One of the interesting things for me about fly fishing

13:28.000 --> 13:30.160
is I find it very meditative, actually.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.960
I'm out in Utah, and I know a lot of dudes

13:32.960 --> 13:36.320
that have this very intense relationship to fly fishing.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.520
And my theory is that what they actually need is meditation,

13:39.520 --> 13:43.840
but they're too doodly to actually do that explicitly.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.480
But fly fishing is like cover, right?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.600
You're like, oh, I'm fly fishing.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.280
But it can't just be like a superficial cover.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.200
You just can't go pretend to yourself

13:51.200 --> 13:52.880
and then go out there and try to meditate.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.240
The whole point is that meditation doesn't happen

13:56.240 --> 13:57.520
when you aim at meditating.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.840
Meditating happens for me on the river

13:59.840 --> 14:01.840
when I'm trying to catch fish,

14:01.840 --> 14:04.080
which means I'm trying to look at my surroundings

14:04.080 --> 14:05.520
to find signs of fish.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.880
And so that goal forces me to pay much more attention

14:08.880 --> 14:11.440
than I would ever pay to the fine details

14:11.440 --> 14:12.560
of the surface of the water.

14:13.360 --> 14:18.640
And then I achieve meditation, kind of accidentally.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.360
There's a philosophy term for this, a self-effacing end.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.240
A self-effacing end is an end you can't aim at directly.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.480
My favorite version of this is relaxation.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.760
You can't relax just by being like, I'm going to relax.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.000
You can't relax by trying harder to relax.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.320
I relax by trying to climb rocks.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.720
So there's a place where the goal is to go up,

14:36.720 --> 14:40.400
but the purpose is to cleanse my mind and relax.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.720
Deepen your subject knowledge,

14:46.720 --> 14:49.920
exchange innovative ideas and augment your existing income.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.040
There are so many reasons to become a Pearson Examiner.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.120
In addition to enriching your expertise

14:55.120 --> 14:56.240
and progressing your career,

14:56.240 --> 14:58.320
you'll be better prepared to help your learners

14:58.320 --> 15:00.400
achieve future success in their exams.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.200
With flexible working options and full training provided,

15:03.200 --> 15:05.760
becoming a Pearson Examiner will open opportunities

15:05.760 --> 15:07.280
for both you and your students.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.760
It's a bona fide win-win situation.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.000
AI is incredible.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It can teach you how to fry an egg

15:20.000 --> 15:22.560
and even write a poem, pirate style.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.240
But it knows nothing about your work.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.320
Slackbot is different.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.240
It doesn't just know the facts.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.760
It knows your schedule.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.240
It can turn a brainstorm into a brief.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.480
And it doesn't need to be taught

15:36.480 --> 15:39.200
because Slackbot isn't just another AI.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.600
It's AI that knows your work as well as you do.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.040
So sort of running through the book as well,

15:51.040 --> 15:53.520
that's sort of veering over the whole thing

15:53.520 --> 15:56.720
is perhaps the evil sibling of the story,

15:56.720 --> 15:58.000
if I can call it that.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.200
And that's metrics.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.000
So what do we mean by metric?

16:02.640 --> 16:03.520
What is a metric?

16:04.080 --> 16:06.000
A metric, one way to put it is a metric

16:06.000 --> 16:08.800
is a scoring system for reality, right?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.960
A game is a scoring system imposed

16:10.960 --> 16:13.200
on an artificial separate universe.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.920
It's this old idea that games happen in a magic circle

16:15.920 --> 16:18.080
and you go in and you try to, you know,

16:18.080 --> 16:20.000
destroy your spouse and then you step back and you're like,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.120
ah, everything's fine again.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.320
Metrics are what happens when you use quantitative data

16:27.280 --> 16:30.160
about the real world and you transform that

16:30.160 --> 16:31.920
into a target or a scoring system.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.880
It's when you target something that can be easily measured.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.640
In the game's half of the book,

16:36.640 --> 16:38.720
the core concept is striving play, which we've talked about.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.440
On the metric side, the core concept for me

16:41.440 --> 16:43.200
is the idea of value capture.

16:43.840 --> 16:49.200
Value capture is what happens when your values

16:49.200 --> 16:50.800
are kind of rich and subtle

16:51.360 --> 16:53.440
and then you enter an institution or a social setting

16:53.440 --> 16:54.720
that feeds you simplified,

16:54.720 --> 16:57.200
typically quantified renditions of those values

16:57.200 --> 16:58.880
and the simplified ones take over.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.640
So for me, it was going to philosophy graduate school

17:02.640 --> 17:04.000
out of a love of philosophy

17:04.000 --> 17:06.560
and then coming out obsessed with citation rates

17:06.560 --> 17:08.160
in highly ranked journals.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.680
For a lot of scientists I know,

17:09.680 --> 17:10.960
they go into the love of wisdom

17:10.960 --> 17:13.040
and they come out obsessed with like grant numbers

17:13.040 --> 17:14.880
and how big your grants are.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.440
For journalists, it becomes page views.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.040
For a lot of us on social media,

17:19.040 --> 17:21.440
you start wanting communication

17:21.440 --> 17:24.160
and you start ending up wanting likes.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.200
And so the important thing for me about a metric

17:27.200 --> 17:29.280
is that a metric presents you a target

17:29.280 --> 17:30.560
and a target that's limited

17:30.560 --> 17:32.160
in the way we talked about before.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.480
It's limited because of the need

17:34.480 --> 17:36.160
for everyone to count together.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.400
So it's limited to touching on the kind of features

17:38.400 --> 17:41.760
that everyone can count easily, height, number of flips.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.440
And then if what's actually valuable

17:46.160 --> 17:48.000
is not what's easily counted,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.800
then value capture will tend to push your values away

17:53.840 --> 17:55.280
from what actually matters.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.920
By the way, maybe this will entertain you.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.920
I have a favorite example of this in normal life

18:01.920 --> 18:03.200
that got cut from the book

18:03.200 --> 18:05.840
because it seemed gross,

18:05.840 --> 18:07.920
but I think you'll find it interesting.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.440
So while I was reading this,

18:09.440 --> 18:12.480
I started researching pickup artist culture.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.120
And interestingly, pickup artists

18:15.120 --> 18:16.080
have been really well studied

18:16.080 --> 18:18.160
by sociologists and anthropologists.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.920
There's a sociologist, Eric Hendricks,

18:19.920 --> 18:22.000
who embedded with pickup artists for a while.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.520
So pickup artist culture is people,

18:23.520 --> 18:24.720
mostly but not always men,

18:24.720 --> 18:26.720
who compete for sexual success.

18:26.720 --> 18:30.560
And one of the interesting things that he discovered

18:31.120 --> 18:34.960
was that pickup artists are uninterested in happiness.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.400
In fact, one of the standard mottoes is

18:36.400 --> 18:37.920
you have to sacrifice any interest

18:37.920 --> 18:40.080
in happiness or pleasure in order to win.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.320
So what pickup artists typically compete for,

18:42.320 --> 18:44.320
and I think this is like one of my favorite examples,

18:44.320 --> 18:47.760
is number of phone numbers you get in the night,

18:47.760 --> 18:50.080
number of sexual acts you get in a month,

18:50.080 --> 18:51.440
speed from meeting someone

18:51.440 --> 18:53.600
to some kind of sexual interaction.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.880
Here's what they don't compete for,

18:55.600 --> 18:58.000
romance, quality relationships,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.680
or even pleasure, right?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.920
This is one of the things that blew my mind.

19:01.920 --> 19:05.520
I thought pickup artists would be evil,

19:06.560 --> 19:09.200
but at least enjoys themselves.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.640
But I think something else has happened

19:10.640 --> 19:11.920
that's even worse.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.280
And hopefully it's clear.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.120
The whole point is that pickup artistry

19:17.680 --> 19:21.120
has shifted the need for competition

19:21.120 --> 19:22.960
and accountability about your competition

19:23.680 --> 19:25.920
and transparency about your wins

19:25.920 --> 19:28.560
has led to a shift of the behavior

19:28.560 --> 19:31.440
towards targeting things that are so far,

19:31.440 --> 19:32.400
at least for me,

19:32.400 --> 19:34.800
from what most of us would think is valuable

19:34.800 --> 19:36.240
in a romantic relationship,

19:36.240 --> 19:38.000
even a short-term one.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.560
And that's an example of value capture,

19:40.560 --> 19:43.920
where they've sacrificed any amount of pleasure

19:43.920 --> 19:46.800
or happiness purely just for essentially,

19:47.120 --> 19:48.080
for a number.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.200
Bragging rights, I suppose,

19:49.200 --> 19:52.240
they can say, you're 10, I'm 12,

19:52.240 --> 19:53.920
I'm better than you sort of thing.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.640
Exactly.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.880
And this is the part where I want to caution,

19:56.880 --> 19:57.520
and I want to be like,

19:57.520 --> 20:00.080
it's really easy to point at other people and laugh,

20:00.080 --> 20:02.400
but I think it's very easy

20:02.400 --> 20:05.280
to find value capture cases in your own life.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.480
I've been value captured by the quest for lower weight,

20:08.480 --> 20:11.760
the quest for optimizing my macronutrients,

20:11.760 --> 20:14.400
the quest to get higher on the philosophy rankings.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.600
Each of these things has for some period of time

20:17.600 --> 20:20.080
consumed me, and it's really wild

20:20.080 --> 20:23.200
because it's so miserable a lot of the times.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.600
The thing that I find really fascinating

20:27.600 --> 20:29.600
is how easy it is to lose your grip

20:29.600 --> 20:30.800
on what really matters

20:30.800 --> 20:33.200
when you're presented with a simple, clear number,

20:33.200 --> 20:34.720
both institutionally,

20:34.720 --> 20:36.800
like in my academic life,

20:36.800 --> 20:39.360
I'm in large-scale institutions that have,

20:39.360 --> 20:42.000
to my mind, stopped targeting things

20:42.000 --> 20:44.560
like teaching curiosity, teaching reflection,

20:44.560 --> 20:46.320
teaching any kind of intellectual virtue,

20:46.320 --> 20:47.520
and started targeting things

20:47.520 --> 20:50.080
like graduation rate and graduation speed.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.440
Again, easy measurables that capture people's attention

20:54.000 --> 20:57.120
because they are easy to express.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.240
Yeah, so I think you mentioned there

21:00.240 --> 21:03.040
one, as you say, slightly gross example,

21:03.040 --> 21:04.480
and then a more serious one,

21:04.480 --> 21:06.960
but the first thing that perhaps came to my mind

21:06.960 --> 21:08.160
when I was thinking about this

21:08.160 --> 21:10.720
is where the emphasis is placed

21:10.720 --> 21:12.880
on the incorrect metric

21:12.880 --> 21:14.720
would be something like GP appointments.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.320
Like there's a lot of talk about this

21:16.320 --> 21:17.840
at the moment over here in the UK,

21:18.560 --> 21:22.400
and you can reach a point where sort of GP practices,

21:22.400 --> 21:24.240
let's say hypothetically,

21:24.240 --> 21:26.720
we're rating these practices

21:26.720 --> 21:28.480
on the number of patients that they're seeing.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.640
So if we're concentrating on that,

21:30.640 --> 21:32.160
obviously what we're going to do

21:32.880 --> 21:34.480
is reduce the appointment time

21:34.480 --> 21:36.480
so we can fit in more appointments per day.

21:37.120 --> 21:40.160
And the only logical conclusion to that

21:40.720 --> 21:43.520
to me seems that the quality of care is going to go down.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.920
But if we're using this metric to rate them on,

21:47.920 --> 21:51.120
it will go up while the quality,

21:51.120 --> 21:52.320
the sort of rating goes up,

21:52.320 --> 21:54.320
while the quality of care goes down.

21:54.320 --> 21:58.000
So is that the kind of example that you're talking about?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.800
Right, that's exactly the kind of example I'm talking about.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.040
Actually, that example is a great one.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.400
I think whenever I talk about this stuff,

22:04.400 --> 22:05.120
everyone wants to tell me

22:05.120 --> 22:06.640
about the terrible metric in their life,

22:06.640 --> 22:09.120
but I think it's actually more unnerving

22:09.200 --> 22:11.040
for me to think about subtler examples.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.560
I think it's going to be really obvious.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.920
I mean, so I'm a professor.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.280
I'm rated on student evaluations.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.960
We all know the way to get high student evaluations

22:18.960 --> 22:20.560
is to make an easy class.

22:20.560 --> 22:21.840
Students don't learn as much,

22:21.840 --> 22:23.360
but you get higher evaluations.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.840
Lousy metrics are really, really obvious.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.960
I think some of the most nauseating cases for me

22:30.960 --> 22:32.720
are cases where the metrics are pretty good,

22:33.840 --> 22:34.960
but imperfect.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.200
And the one that this is perhaps

22:37.200 --> 22:39.200
a politically dangerous view,

22:39.200 --> 22:42.160
but a worrisome one for me that I've been obsessed with

22:42.160 --> 22:44.400
since the COVID pandemic is the degree

22:44.400 --> 22:46.960
to which easy public health metrics

22:46.960 --> 22:50.560
like lives saved and life expectancy

22:51.440 --> 22:53.840
tend to trump other considerations

22:53.840 --> 22:56.160
like life quality, cultural quality,

22:56.160 --> 22:57.840
community, mental health.

22:58.480 --> 23:02.160
And I'm not saying that it's not important to save lives,

23:02.960 --> 23:06.000
but I'm saying maybe a less controversial example for me

23:06.000 --> 23:09.200
is like saturated fats, like cheese, right?

23:09.200 --> 23:13.520
It's very easy to track heart attack rates,

23:13.520 --> 23:16.880
longer lifespans, very hard to track culinary joy.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.120
The claim here isn't anti-scientific.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.200
There is a genuine real correlation

23:21.200 --> 23:23.280
between saturated fats and heart attack rates.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.440
The claim is certain kinds of things

23:25.440 --> 23:28.080
that are easier to measure tend to beat out automatically

23:28.080 --> 23:30.960
and unthinkingly other harder to measure values.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.800
And try to understand this.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.280
So there's one common response here,

23:35.280 --> 23:36.800
which is, oh, that's just a bad metric.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.560
We need to find better metrics.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.320
And I had this gut, a lot of the time

23:40.320 --> 23:41.040
when I was thinking about this,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.840
I had this gut response that you wouldn't be able

23:43.840 --> 23:46.640
to find better metrics for certain kinds of things,

23:46.640 --> 23:48.480
especially central human values.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.760
And I was trying to understand why.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.520
And I found some answers,

23:51.520 --> 23:54.560
especially from some philosophers like Elizabeth Barnes

23:54.560 --> 23:56.000
who works on the notion of health

23:56.000 --> 23:57.440
and then a bunch of historians

23:57.440 --> 23:59.920
in a field called science and technology studies.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.960
So Theodore Porter unlocked a huge amount

24:02.960 --> 24:03.680
of this stuff for me.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.880
And this is a thing I am literally dying to talk about

24:06.880 --> 24:08.480
on the BBC science podcast.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.680
Because this, okay.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.480
So Theodore Porter was a historian

24:12.480 --> 24:14.880
who was inspired by actually by a bunch of philosophers

24:14.880 --> 24:17.520
I have to claim like Ian Hacking and Bruno Latour.

24:17.520 --> 24:21.360
And he was really interested in why politicians

24:21.360 --> 24:23.760
and administrators tended to unthinking

24:23.760 --> 24:27.440
kind of automatically reach for quantitative justification,

24:27.440 --> 24:29.040
even when the metrics were bad.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.640
So the theory he developed was that

24:32.640 --> 24:35.200
there were two kinds of ways of knowing about the world,

24:35.200 --> 24:36.640
qualitative and quantitative.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.920
And it's not that quantitative is bad.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.760
It's that each of them is a tool designed

24:41.760 --> 24:43.120
for a different purpose

24:43.120 --> 24:45.040
with different strengths and weaknesses.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.560
And the problem is compulsively reaching

24:46.560 --> 24:47.440
for the quantitative.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.200
So qualitative justification, written words,

24:51.200 --> 24:53.760
is open-ended, dynamic, subtle, rich,

24:53.760 --> 24:56.320
but it travels badly between contexts

24:56.320 --> 24:58.720
because it requires a huge amount of shared background.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.000
So one way for me, my example is as a professor,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.800
when I write qualitative evaluations of my students,

25:04.800 --> 25:06.960
I can respond along multiple dimensions.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.360
I don't have to declare a single overall score.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.640
I can be like, well, you're really creative,

25:10.640 --> 25:11.440
but it wasn't as rigorous.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.640
I didn't have to settle that up.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.880
And I can also use all the rich language,

25:14.880 --> 25:16.480
a philosophy of my class.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.480
But one, those things don't travel well.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.840
Like people from the business school

25:21.840 --> 25:22.960
will not understand my comments

25:22.960 --> 25:25.360
and I won't understand their student comments.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.280
And two, they do not aggregate well.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.040
Like thousands of student evaluations don't aggregate.

25:31.920 --> 25:36.720
So what Porter says is quantitative information

25:36.720 --> 25:38.880
is a kind of instrument that's designed

25:38.880 --> 25:40.640
to get around this problem.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.600
When we create quantitative information in an institution,

25:44.480 --> 25:47.440
we identify a context-invariant kernel.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.640
We find something that's stable across all contexts,

25:50.640 --> 25:53.360
that everyone from different backgrounds can understand.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.440
We agree on it, we rigidify it,

25:55.440 --> 25:59.280
and then we can all understand and connect and collect into it.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.600
So in the US, this is GPA, grade point average.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.120
If you get an A, that's a four.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.400
If you get a B, that's a three.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.640
Every student work can be pushed into a single spectrum

26:08.640 --> 26:10.160
that can be quickly averaged

26:10.160 --> 26:11.440
and get a grade point average.

26:12.240 --> 26:18.240
So Porter's insight is that data has been designed to travel.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.760
His term is that it's portable.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.760
It's been made to be portable.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.000
And the way it's made to be portable

26:24.000 --> 26:27.440
is it has context and subtlety stripped out.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.040
It's been designed to be understood across contexts.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.640
So I think the thing that Porter identifies for me

26:34.640 --> 26:36.720
is that the kind of what I would call

26:36.720 --> 26:39.360
the insensitivity and inhumanity of metrics

26:39.360 --> 26:40.800
is an essential design feature.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.320
In order to communicate readily at scale,

26:44.320 --> 26:46.800
we have to strip off things that require

26:46.800 --> 26:48.640
high context and nuance to understand.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.120
So the thing that makes metrics powerful,

26:53.120 --> 26:55.920
that is the quick aggregation, the easy comprehensibility,

26:56.000 --> 27:01.120
is achieved precisely at the cost of loss of nuance.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.800
And I'm not saying this is bad in every case.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.880
Like this is also, this is not just metrics.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.000
This is science, right?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.960
The reason why it's really easy to optimize

27:08.960 --> 27:11.440
for certain things like antibiotics

27:11.440 --> 27:13.680
is that having an antibiotic stop your infection

27:13.680 --> 27:15.680
is really easy for everyone to see.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.080
Having a lifesaving measure save on someone's life,

27:18.080 --> 27:19.360
that's easy to count.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.480
So those are the kinds of things

27:20.480 --> 27:22.720
that are very easy to collect large scale data for.

27:23.680 --> 27:27.040
Things that are highly variable require high sensitivity

27:27.040 --> 27:28.880
or that are subtle are very hard.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.360
And this is not saying they're not real, right?

27:31.920 --> 27:34.000
It's just saying that they're hard for everyone

27:34.000 --> 27:36.080
to assess quickly and easily.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.120
One of my favorite examples of here is like,

27:39.120 --> 27:43.120
so there are a lot of legal rights that we connect to age.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.120
And what we actually don't, we don't actually care about age.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.320
What we actually care about is intellectual

27:48.320 --> 27:52.480
and emotional maturity, but it would be a disaster

27:52.560 --> 27:55.440
if we granted voting rights based on intellectual

27:55.440 --> 27:56.480
and emotional maturity, right?

27:56.480 --> 27:58.080
You would need a particular judge.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.880
So there's a case where we make a trade-off

28:00.880 --> 28:03.280
and instead of exactly tracking the thing,

28:03.280 --> 28:05.920
we find a mechanical line in the U.S.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.760
You get to vote if you're 18, right?

28:08.480 --> 28:10.400
And that mechanical line is inarguable.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.320
Everyone assesses it at the same place.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.000
And that's a case where I think it's great.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.840
It is fantastic that for voting,

28:15.840 --> 28:18.240
we have a clear mechanical line that everyone can replicate.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.600
But for other things, like, I don't know,

28:21.600 --> 28:26.000
choosing your arts grants or choosing your fitness routine

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
or choosing what your career is.

28:28.960 --> 28:32.480
These things, it's less important that our decision procedure

28:32.480 --> 28:35.920
and our targeting procedure are bound by the standard

28:35.920 --> 28:41.600
of absolute context-crossing decontextualization.

28:41.600 --> 28:45.520
I mean, the quick way to put it is that for Porter,

28:46.480 --> 28:52.080
data and therefore metrics are a designed engineer technology

28:52.080 --> 28:56.400
that gets us fast, portable aggregability

28:56.400 --> 28:57.520
at the cost of context.

28:58.400 --> 29:03.440
Yeah, so another thing that you talk about is the appeal of metrics.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.640
And I don't think it's just their tidiness.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.480
It's kind of the kind of authority

29:08.480 --> 29:10.000
that they seem to carry within them.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.280
You know, that's the final verdict on this issue.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.080
This such and such is five out of 10.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.800
That's it, you know, and so we're kind of,

29:18.800 --> 29:20.640
do you think we're less likely to challenge that

29:20.640 --> 29:23.600
because it seems like it is so black and white?

29:23.600 --> 29:27.760
Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of, this has been this puzzle for me

29:27.760 --> 29:30.480
for the longest time of why these things are so seductive.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.520
One of the early explanations I had was that

29:33.520 --> 29:35.760
there's this kind of like existential soothingness,

29:35.760 --> 29:39.520
like it's really painful to be exposed to the complexity of real values

29:39.520 --> 29:40.800
and this makes things easy.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.000
That's one explanation.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.280
Another explanation is that it's just easier to communicate.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.240
And Porter tells us why.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.920
It's been designed to be easier to communicate.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.440
Lately, I've been thinking, I even came up with a term for it

29:51.440 --> 29:53.760
literally yesterday in my graduate seminar,

29:53.760 --> 29:55.280
talking to my students about this.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.400
A lot of the times, the way we say that something is objective

29:58.400 --> 30:02.240
versus subjective is that we get someone else's confirmation.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.400
They see it too, right?

30:04.400 --> 30:07.440
That is literally the basic, if you go back to like

30:07.440 --> 30:11.600
old Hume classics of empiricist philosophy,

30:12.400 --> 30:16.640
you know that the feeling of warmth is subjective

30:16.640 --> 30:19.200
because different people experience it differently in the same place

30:19.200 --> 30:21.280
and you know that temperature is objective

30:21.280 --> 30:24.240
because different people will come up with the same measurement, right?

30:24.240 --> 30:28.560
But I kind of think metrics do a kind of objectivity hacking, right?

30:28.560 --> 30:33.520
They create a quick, easy shortcut to agreement and convergence

30:34.320 --> 30:38.960
by zeroing in on features that are highly accessible.

30:39.760 --> 30:45.280
And so this is, I feel like we're headed into like weirdo technical philosophy,

30:45.280 --> 30:47.200
but the thing that's really interesting to me

30:47.200 --> 30:51.360
is the difference between what's real and what's important

30:52.080 --> 30:54.880
and what's easily observable by anybody,

30:54.880 --> 30:57.520
especially under conditions of quickness and speed.

30:58.480 --> 31:04.800
And metrics are designed to create easy convergence at speed among everybody.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.280
They're a shortcut to the appearance of objectivity.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.560
So we've talked about quite a lot there,

31:10.560 --> 31:13.440
a lot of different pitfalls that are in this.

31:13.440 --> 31:16.960
So sort of for someone who's listening, he's thinking, you know,

31:16.960 --> 31:21.520
how can they avoid falling foul of these pitfalls?

31:21.520 --> 31:24.240
You know, what can we learn from games?

31:24.240 --> 31:28.640
And you talk about the notion of play, which is really interesting,

31:28.640 --> 31:31.600
that we can actually apply in our own lives,

31:31.600 --> 31:33.600
because often it can feel like a lot of these things

31:33.600 --> 31:35.440
are just completely out of our own control.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.400
Yeah, I mean, not only A, a lot of these systems are out of our control

31:40.400 --> 31:42.640
and a lot of the fixes here are structural.

31:42.640 --> 31:46.320
I'm not going to sit here and say like, we can fix this through individual grit.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.720
Like a lot of this is because of the way the institutions work.

31:49.520 --> 31:53.840
Even there, you can find different relationships to external scoring systems.

31:54.720 --> 31:58.480
And it's important to remember that we do use them all the time.

31:58.480 --> 32:02.720
Even I think even the best relationship to scoring systems in the world

32:02.720 --> 32:05.600
is going to constantly use them because scoring systems

32:05.600 --> 32:09.040
are a response to real needs to understand other people,

32:10.240 --> 32:16.000
to make them transparent to us, to get information quickly.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.400
Like I use rankings when I buy household gadgets.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.560
I don't have the time to research every dishwasher.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.760
I use rankings, right?

32:23.760 --> 32:25.760
They're summarized compressed information.

32:26.320 --> 32:30.000
What you want to do is realize that they're highly lossy,

32:30.560 --> 32:34.800
highly information devoid, highly thin packages

32:35.680 --> 32:39.200
that are useful, maybe a starting point that are not complete.

32:39.840 --> 32:44.480
And I think games offer us a really good glimpse of what we can do

32:44.480 --> 32:47.280
because I think the life that games,

32:47.280 --> 32:48.960
it's not that they automatically give this to you,

32:48.960 --> 32:52.080
but the life they encourage is a life in which

32:52.080 --> 32:55.520
you enter scoring systems voluntarily

32:56.080 --> 32:59.360
and you choose which ones you want to have

33:00.080 --> 33:02.640
and you can modify them, right?

33:02.640 --> 33:04.720
Like the difference in games, I mean, this is,

33:04.720 --> 33:07.120
and this is in many ways, it's a structural difference, right?

33:07.120 --> 33:12.480
You can house rule your poker game or your Dungeons and Dragons game.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.200
You can't house rule GPA because of the way that metrics function.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.640
But the closest you can approximate to that is something like,

33:19.360 --> 33:22.640
I think games encourage something that I want to call reflective control.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.520
So games encourage trying a scoring system

33:25.520 --> 33:29.600
and then not just assuming that we have to play this particular board game forever,

33:29.600 --> 33:32.480
but thinking afterwards, was it worth it?

33:32.480 --> 33:33.120
Was it fun?

33:33.120 --> 33:35.840
And what you're doing is transitioning between

33:35.840 --> 33:38.240
being absorbed in a particular game goal

33:38.240 --> 33:40.480
and reflecting more deeply on its purpose

33:40.480 --> 33:42.880
and whether that purpose was rich or meaningful to you.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.880
And you can just decide, now that game sucked,

33:44.880 --> 33:45.760
I'm not going to play it again.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.000
Or that game was kind of good, but I'm going to modify it.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.680
You have some degree of control and games make that easy

33:51.680 --> 33:53.680
because there are so many and they're so disconnected.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.520
I think that's the right attitude.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.120
It's much harder to apply in the world

33:57.120 --> 34:01.520
because you don't have these isolated, easily movable between packages

34:01.520 --> 34:02.320
like you do with games.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.800
You get these massive world-spanning systems.

34:04.800 --> 34:09.200
But still, there's a difference between treating your subscriber count

34:09.200 --> 34:13.200
or your likes or your page views as a rough proxy

34:13.200 --> 34:14.800
that gives you some information

34:14.800 --> 34:17.360
versus treating it, taking on as your core value.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.680
I think one crucial part of that is,

34:22.480 --> 34:23.920
if you take it on as your core value,

34:23.920 --> 34:26.320
you don't have a standpoint from which to reflect

34:26.320 --> 34:27.760
on whether it's working out for you.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.920
If you think the point of your life is just to make the most money

34:29.920 --> 34:32.880
or get the most followers, then that's it.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.240
That's just what you're doing.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.520
But if you're thinking to yourself,

34:35.520 --> 34:39.120
I'm trying to get followers in order to communicate

34:39.120 --> 34:42.320
and connect with people, then you have a stance

34:42.320 --> 34:45.040
from which you can limit your devotion to that simple metric.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.480

Every Monday and Friday, you'll hear world-leading scientists and experts

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
talking about the most fascinating ideas in science and technology today.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm Jason Goodger, Commissioning Editor at BBC Science Focus.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,640
In the world of games, scoring systems establish a framework

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
that provides us with clear challenges, motivation

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,040
and ultimately delivers a huge amount of fun and pleasure.

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,000
However, on the flip side, the increasing tendency to apply rankings and metrics

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
to almost every area of our personal and professional lives

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
can have a dehumanising effect, reducing our actions,

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,240
performance and even ourselves to a simple string of numbers.

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
In today's episode, we're joined by C.T. Nguyen, a games researcher

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,480
and associate professor of philosophy based at the University of Utah,

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,360
to talk about his latest book, The Score, How to Stop Playing Someone Else's Game.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,800
He explains how in the real world, scoring systems typically fail to provide meaning

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
by focusing on the simplest to measure outcomes.

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,160
How purely numerical data is, by definition, lacking in nuance.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
How, by concentrating on what we truly value,

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
we can all break free from the tyranny of rankings and metrics.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
T, welcome to the podcast. Thanks so much for joining us.

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Today, we're talking about your latest book, The Score,

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,960
How to Stop Playing Someone Else's Game.

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,000
That's quite a provocative title, I'd say.

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
It's all about the notion of games and gamification.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
First off, to get us all on the same page,

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,880
you hear the term bandied around a lot, but what exactly do we mean by gamification?

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,000
I started writing this book because I became obsessed with a question

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,800
that came up from two different streams of what I was thinking about.

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,920
One stream was about how games and scoring systems often lead to such delightful play,

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,240
and the other half was about how gamification's rankings and metrics,

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,120
my experience of them in education, institution, online, on social media,

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,560
seem to drain the life out of everything and ruin my experience of communication,

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,080
of education, of being a researcher, of being a person.

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,600
I wanted to understand that.

63
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,080
Gamification is a really complicated term.

64
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,520
The first thing to say about gamification is that gamification is taking the kind of

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,520
superficial trappings of a game, the leveling experience, the scoring experience,

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,080
the fact that you're getting points, and applying it to a non-game context,

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
applying it to work, applying it to education.

68
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,800
Underneath and more deep down, I think one way to put it,

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,040
and this is maybe my own quirky usage, is that games are things,

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,240
they're kind of artificial activities that you create and invent,

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,400
and to do that you use a scoring system.

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
And gamifications are taking something that we're actually already doing

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
with an actually extant goal, right?

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,360
We're already trying to learn things, we're already trying to get healthier,

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,560
we're already trying to increase our scientific product,

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
and then applying the appearance and mechanics of a scoring system

77
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,240
and slapping that onto a real-life activity, and I think substantively transforming it.

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
Yeah, so let's start with scoring systems, and I think while it might not necessarily always

79
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,600
be in the forefront of our minds, if we stop and think for just a few seconds,

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,720
scoring systems or ranking systems are everywhere, grades at school, sports leagues,

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,720
movie reviews, and even in things like artistic pursuits.

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,080
So I play classical guitar, and I've forgotten the amount of times I've played a piece for somebody,

83
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,440
and the first thing they say is,

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,760
Oof, that looks tricky, what grade is it?

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,000
You know, they want to know what level it's at.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,040
It's really, really interesting, isn't it? Like psychologically.

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,680
So first off, is there a sort of quick and dirty definition of what a scoring system is?

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
You know, how can we define it?

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,320
A scoring system, I think it's a particular kind of social technology.

90
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
It's a way of doing things.

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
I worked some in the philosophy of technology,

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,080
and I have a really broad definition of a technology.

93
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,920
A technology is a way of doing things.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,720
Sometimes it's material, but sometimes it's like an idea or a way of organizing an institution.

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Like for a lot of people in the space, like the idea of a factory,

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,640
the idea of an assembly line is a kind of technology.

97
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,120
It's a new way of doing things that changes the world.

98
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
I think the scoring system is something similar.

99
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
A scoring system is a social technology.

100
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
It's a method for guaranteeing a convergence of judgments.

101
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,800
It's some way of specifying in an official way how we're going to judge things so we all get on board.

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,920
And I think one thing, so the book we're talking about,

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,000
it's my first popular book, but it's my second book.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
My first book was an academic book about games.

105
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
And that first book, one of the things I really wanted to talk about

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
was the beauty of games as this designed art form

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
that weren't just stories or narratives or worlds,

108
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,400
but were specifying alternate selves.

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,960
So I was really inspired while I was reading this stuff

110
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,400
by a lecture at the Game Developers Conference

111
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,960
by Reiner Knizia, who's my favorite board game designer.

112
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,240
He's a German genius of board game design.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
And he says in this moment that the scoring system

114
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
is the most important design tool in his toolbox

115
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
because it tells the players what to care about.

116
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
It sets their motivations in the game.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
Like you open up a game, you open up a board game,

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
and you find out what you're trying to do.

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,720
You find out whether your cares are going to be aligned with other people

120
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
or aligned with team or whether you're completely individualistic.

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,000
You find out whether you're getting points for killing people

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
or collecting resources, right?

123
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,040
They tell you what to do.

124
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
But one thing I missed, and I kind of can't believe I missed it,

125
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,240
I think it's because I was obsessed with board games

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,480
when I was writing the first book.

127
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,200
I thought that every game had to have a scoring system.

128
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,520
And now I realize that they don't.

129
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
And it's actually really valuable to look at the difference

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
between unscored and scored games.

131
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,600
So there are a lot of games and a lot of even competitive games

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
that don't have a scoring system.

133
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,640
And a lot of these look like aesthetic games.

134
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,040
So my favorite example is like skateboarding.

135
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,280
When people go to the skate park, I'm not a skateboarder.

136
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm a rock climber, I'm a fisher, but I'm not a skateboarder.

137
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,200
So all of this is secondhand knowledge.

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,960
They're often, they are competing and they're competing for cool.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,920
By the way, I should confess, in my first draft of this book,

140
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,760
I said that skateboarders were competing for the coolest trick.

141
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,080
And a 20 something year old editor, Penguin, who's a skateboarder,

142
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
she wrote me a note and said,

143
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,640
you sound old and out of touch with her misdeeds.

144
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,480
It turned out to mean stylish ease, which I love.

145
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,160
I didn't know. I feel like a poser saying this.

146
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,920
But like, so there's often an aesthetic competition

147
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,960
and you don't have a pre-established way of figuring out who won.

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
And in fact, you can go and come out with a,

149
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,040
A, you don't need to have a single conclusion.

150
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,720
You can be like, oh, I wanted to skate park

151
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
and this person did the most explosive trick

152
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
and this person did the most beautiful trick.

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
That's fine. You don't need to see a single conclusion.

154
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,160
And you also don't need a bunch of people

155
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
to come to the same conclusion, right?

156
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
You can have the competition, right?

157
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
I mean, I think in a very casual sense,

158
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,760
if you're sitting around your friends

159
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,040
and like casually competing to tell the funniest joke,

160
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,240
it's clear that it's a competition and it's clear that it's a game,

161
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,840
but you don't need a method to settle who won officially.

162
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,000
And you see these transitions.

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,280
There's a transition in skateboarding

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,520
when skateboarding went official,

165
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,600
when it went to ESPNX games and the Olympics.

166
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,840
They needed a clearer way to produce something

167
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,760
that looked like an objective score.

168
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,240
And so the practice shifted

169
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,880
from a kind of more aesthetic, stylish practice

170
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,640
to one centered on more mechanistic, easier to measure,

171
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,640
easier to publicly validate goals, height, and number of flips.

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
The entire practice shifted in order to make it easy

173
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,920
for everyone to agree on the same judgment.

174
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,520
And I think in some sense, what this book is about

175
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,680
is worrying on the smaller scale.

176
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
Maybe this kind of scoring system change

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
robs us of something in skateboarding, maybe.

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
But I'm worried about this in the large scale

179
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,000
that this is happening everywhere, globally,

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,840
that we are shifting consistently from subtler, richer,

181
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,120
but still real targets to easier to measure, easier to count,

182
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
easier to agree on targets,

183
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,280
and that this is shifting what we care about.

184
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,760
Part of what I say in the book is that the thing that

185
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm really worried about is what I'm calling the gap.

186
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,480
And the gap is the distance between what actually matters

187
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,880
and what's easy to measure and easy to count in a public manner.

188
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,840
And those aren't the same.

189
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
And I think it's really easy to think.

190
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,840
I mean, I don't know how technical you want to get,

191
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
but one way for me to put it is it's really easy

192
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
for us to make this slide into thinking

193
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,520
that what's easy to count together is all that's real.

194
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
It's all that's objective.

195
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,480
Actually, no, there are plenty of things that are real

196
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
and really important, that are very subtle

197
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
and require a lot of experience to understand.

198
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,960
But the demand of scoring systems that we count in unison easily,

199
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,680
that the counting rules be accessible to everyone

200
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,280
and that everyone can count in the same way,

201
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,160
they shift what we target in a profound and systematic way.

202
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Yeah, so in the book, you write something

203
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,400
that I thought was really fascinating,

204
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,880
something that I've actually thought myself

205
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
that's fly fishing.

206
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I've never actually been fly fishing myself,

207
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,960
but when I was younger, I was a keen course angler.

208
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
I often go with my dad and my twin.

209
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,840
And of course, you naturally enter into a competition

210
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,560
without even trying to, who can catch the biggest fish,

211
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,080
who can catch the most different species or whatever.

212
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,680
But if you were to ask me now, 20, well, blind me,

213
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
30 odd years later, what do I remember from that?

214
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,800
I don't remember the day that I caught the most fish.

215
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,960
I don't remember the biggest fish that I caught.

216
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,960
I just remember spending time with my family outdoors,

217
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,320
having a really good time.

218
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,920
So in the book, you have a sentence

219
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,360
that while catching fish may be the goal of fishing,

220
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
it's not the purpose.

221
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
And I think that's a really key point.

222
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,600
So can you unpack that idea for us, please?

223
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
Yeah, this is one of the central ideas, I think.

224
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,040
And one of the things why, I know some people think it's weird

225
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
that I'm a philosopher and I think a lot about games.

226
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
I think games teach us something really important about,

227
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,280
I mean, maybe this sounds pretentious,

228
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,480
but the meaning of life.

229
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
And it's there in what you just said.

230
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,000
I started thinking about this because I think a moment,

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,680
I was in graduate school and my mentor, Barbara Herman,

232
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,480
the esteemed Kantian ethicist who terrified everyone,

233
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
she was saying something.

234
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
And all the graduate students are always trying

235
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,400
to catch out the professors.

236
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,240
And we were like, oh, that doesn't make sense.

237
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
And we tried to, I can't even remember what the point was.

238
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,520
And she was like, oh, you're all making a mistake.

239
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,160
You're just failing to distinguish between a goal

240
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,040
and a purpose.

241
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
And all those were like, ah, there's no such thing

242
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,280
as a difference.

243
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,400
And those are the same thing.

244
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,960
And she says, no, when you invite your friends over

245
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,800
for a night of cards, the goal is to win,

246
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
but the purpose is to have fun.

247
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
And these are really different, right?

248
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,760
I think one way to put it is that the goal of a game

249
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
is what you formally pursue in the game.

250
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
It's the stated goal of the game.

251
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
It's the victory condition.

252
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,800
And the purpose is why you play.

253
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
And there are different reasons to play.

254
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
For some people, I call them achievement players.

255
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,560
Some people play the game in order to win.

256
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,000
That's the value for them, right?

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Either because it gets them something they want,

258
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,680
like status or money, or because they just want to win.

259
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,640
That's achievement play.

260
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,720
Another kind of player is a striving player.

261
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,520
And a striving player is somebody who tries to win

262
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,720
in order to have a process of interesting or beautiful

263
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
or satisfying struggle.

264
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
What they care about is the struggle.

265
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
And the interesting thing for me about games

266
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
is that in the posture of striving play,

267
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,920
what you care about is the process,

268
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,840
but you can't get that process without trying to win.

269
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,000
One of the interesting things for me about fly fishing

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
is I find it very meditative, actually.

271
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,960
I'm out in Utah, and I know a lot of dudes

272
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,320
that have this very intense relationship to fly fishing.

273
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,520
And my theory is that what they actually need is meditation,

274
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,840
but they're too doodly to actually do that explicitly.

275
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
But fly fishing is like cover, right?

276
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
You're like, oh, I'm fly fishing.

277
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,280
But it can't just be like a superficial cover.

278
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,200
You just can't go pretend to yourself

279
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,880
and then go out there and try to meditate.

280
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,240
The whole point is that meditation doesn't happen

281
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,520
when you aim at meditating.

282
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,840
Meditating happens for me on the river

283
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
when I'm trying to catch fish,

284
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,080
which means I'm trying to look at my surroundings

285
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,520
to find signs of fish.

286
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,880
And so that goal forces me to pay much more attention

287
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
than I would ever pay to the fine details

288
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,560
of the surface of the water.

289
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,640
And then I achieve meditation, kind of accidentally.

290
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,360
There's a philosophy term for this, a self-effacing end.

291
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
A self-effacing end is an end you can't aim at directly.

292
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
My favorite version of this is relaxation.

293
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
You can't relax just by being like, I'm going to relax.

294
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,000
You can't relax by trying harder to relax.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,320
I relax by trying to climb rocks.

296
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,720
So there's a place where the goal is to go up,

297
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,400
but the purpose is to cleanse my mind and relax.

298
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,720
Deepen your subject knowledge,

299
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
exchange innovative ideas and augment your existing income.

300
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
There are so many reasons to become a Pearson Examiner.

301
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
In addition to enriching your expertise

302
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
and progressing your career,

303
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
you'll be better prepared to help your learners

304
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,400
achieve future success in their exams.

305
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
With flexible working options and full training provided,

306
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,760
becoming a Pearson Examiner will open opportunities

307
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,280
for both you and your students.

308
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,760

AI is incredible.

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It can teach you how to fry an egg

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
and even write a poem, pirate style.

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
But it knows nothing about your work.

315
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,320
Slackbot is different.

316
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
It doesn't just know the facts.

317
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,760
It knows your schedule.

318
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,240
It can turn a brainstorm into a brief.

319
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
And it doesn't need to be taught

320
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,200
because Slackbot isn't just another AI.

321
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,600

323
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
So sort of running through the book as well,

324
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,520
that's sort of veering over the whole thing

325
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,720
is perhaps the evil sibling of the story,

326
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,000
if I can call it that.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
And that's metrics.

328
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,000
So what do we mean by metric?

329
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,520
What is a metric?

330
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
A metric, one way to put it is a metric

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
is a scoring system for reality, right?

332
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,960
A game is a scoring system imposed

333
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,200
on an artificial separate universe.

334
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,920
It's this old idea that games happen in a magic circle

335
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,080
and you go in and you try to, you know,

336
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,000
destroy your spouse and then you step back and you're like,

337
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
ah, everything's fine again.

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,320
Metrics are what happens when you use quantitative data

339
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,160
about the real world and you transform that

340
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,920
into a target or a scoring system.

341
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,880
It's when you target something that can be easily measured.

342
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,640
In the game's half of the book,

343
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,720
the core concept is striving play, which we've talked about.

344
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,440
On the metric side, the core concept for me

345
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,200
is the idea of value capture.

346
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,200
Value capture is what happens when your values

347
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,800
are kind of rich and subtle

348
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
and then you enter an institution or a social setting

349
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,720
that feeds you simplified,

350
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,200
typically quantified renditions of those values

351
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,880
and the simplified ones take over.

352
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,640
So for me, it was going to philosophy graduate school

353
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,000
out of a love of philosophy

354
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,560
and then coming out obsessed with citation rates

355
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,160
in highly ranked journals.

356
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,680
For a lot of scientists I know,

357
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,960
they go into the love of wisdom

358
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,040
and they come out obsessed with like grant numbers

359
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,880
and how big your grants are.

360
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,440
For journalists, it becomes page views.

361
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,040
For a lot of us on social media,

362
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,440
you start wanting communication

363
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,160
and you start ending up wanting likes.

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,200
And so the important thing for me about a metric

365
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,280
is that a metric presents you a target

366
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,560
and a target that's limited

367
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,160
in the way we talked about before.

368
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
It's limited because of the need

369
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
for everyone to count together.

370
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,400
So it's limited to touching on the kind of features

371
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
that everyone can count easily, height, number of flips.

372
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,440
And then if what's actually valuable

373
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
is not what's easily counted,

374
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,800
then value capture will tend to push your values away

375
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
from what actually matters.

376
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,920
By the way, maybe this will entertain you.

377
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,920
I have a favorite example of this in normal life

378
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,200
that got cut from the book

379
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,840
because it seemed gross,

380
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,920
but I think you'll find it interesting.

381
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,440
So while I was reading this,

382
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
I started researching pickup artist culture.

383
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
And interestingly, pickup artists

384
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,080
have been really well studied

385
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
by sociologists and anthropologists.

386
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,920
There's a sociologist, Eric Hendricks,

387
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,000
who embedded with pickup artists for a while.

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
So pickup artist culture is people,

389
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,720
mostly but not always men,

390
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
who compete for sexual success.

391
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,560
And one of the interesting things that he discovered

392
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
was that pickup artists are uninterested in happiness.

393
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
In fact, one of the standard mottoes is

394
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,920
you have to sacrifice any interest

395
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,080
in happiness or pleasure in order to win.

396
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,320
So what pickup artists typically compete for,

397
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
and I think this is like one of my favorite examples,

398
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,760
is number of phone numbers you get in the night,

399
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
number of sexual acts you get in a month,

400
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,440
speed from meeting someone

401
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,600
to some kind of sexual interaction.

402
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,880
Here's what they don't compete for,

403
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
romance, quality relationships,

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
or even pleasure, right?

405
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,920
This is one of the things that blew my mind.

406
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,520
I thought pickup artists would be evil,

407
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,200
but at least enjoys themselves.

408
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
But I think something else has happened

409
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,920
that's even worse.

410
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,280
And hopefully it's clear.

411
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,120
The whole point is that pickup artistry

412
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,120
has shifted the need for competition

413
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,960
and accountability about your competition

414
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,920
and transparency about your wins

415
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,560
has led to a shift of the behavior

416
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,440
towards targeting things that are so far,

417
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
at least for me,

418
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,800
from what most of us would think is valuable

419
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,240
in a romantic relationship,

420
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
even a short-term one.

421
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,560
And that's an example of value capture,

422
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,920
where they've sacrificed any amount of pleasure

423
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,800
or happiness purely just for essentially,

424
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,080
for a number.

425
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,200
Bragging rights, I suppose,

426
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
they can say, you're 10, I'm 12,

427
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm better than you sort of thing.

428
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,640
Exactly.

429
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
And this is the part where I want to caution,

430
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,520
and I want to be like,

431
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,080
it's really easy to point at other people and laugh,

432
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,400
but I think it's very easy

433
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,280
to find value capture cases in your own life.

434
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,480
I've been value captured by the quest for lower weight,

435
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,760
the quest for optimizing my macronutrients,

436
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,400
the quest to get higher on the philosophy rankings.

437
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,600
Each of these things has for some period of time

438
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,080
consumed me, and it's really wild

439
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,200
because it's so miserable a lot of the times.

440
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,600
The thing that I find really fascinating

441
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
is how easy it is to lose your grip

442
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,800
on what really matters

443
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
when you're presented with a simple, clear number,

444
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,720
both institutionally,

445
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,800
like in my academic life,

446
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,360
I'm in large-scale institutions that have,

447
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,000
to my mind, stopped targeting things

448
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,560
like teaching curiosity, teaching reflection,

449
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,320
teaching any kind of intellectual virtue,

450
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
and started targeting things

451
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
like graduation rate and graduation speed.

452
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,440
Again, easy measurables that capture people's attention

453
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,120
because they are easy to express.

454
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
Yeah, so I think you mentioned there

455
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,040
one, as you say, slightly gross example,

456
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,480
and then a more serious one,

457
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,960
but the first thing that perhaps came to my mind

458
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,160
when I was thinking about this

459
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,720
is where the emphasis is placed

460
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
on the incorrect metric

461
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
would be something like GP appointments.

462
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,320
Like there's a lot of talk about this

463
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,840
at the moment over here in the UK,

464
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,400
and you can reach a point where sort of GP practices,

465
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,240
let's say hypothetically,

466
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,720
we're rating these practices

467
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
on the number of patients that they're seeing.

468
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
So if we're concentrating on that,

469
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,160
obviously what we're going to do

470
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,480
is reduce the appointment time

471
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
so we can fit in more appointments per day.

472
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,160
And the only logical conclusion to that

473
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,520
to me seems that the quality of care is going to go down.

474
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,920
But if we're using this metric to rate them on,

475
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,120
it will go up while the quality,

476
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,320
the sort of rating goes up,

477
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
while the quality of care goes down.

478
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,000
So is that the kind of example that you're talking about?

479
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,800
Right, that's exactly the kind of example I'm talking about.

480
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,040
Actually, that example is a great one.

481
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,400
I think whenever I talk about this stuff,

482
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,120
everyone wants to tell me

483
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
about the terrible metric in their life,

484
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
but I think it's actually more unnerving

485
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,040
for me to think about subtler examples.

486
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,560
I think it's going to be really obvious.

487
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,920
I mean, so I'm a professor.

488
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm rated on student evaluations.

489
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
We all know the way to get high student evaluations

490
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,560
is to make an easy class.

491
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,840
Students don't learn as much,

492
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
but you get higher evaluations.

493
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,840
Lousy metrics are really, really obvious.

494
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,960
I think some of the most nauseating cases for me

495
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
are cases where the metrics are pretty good,

496
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
but imperfect.

497
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
And the one that this is perhaps

498
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
a politically dangerous view,

499
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,160
but a worrisome one for me that I've been obsessed with

500
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,400
since the COVID pandemic is the degree

501
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,960
to which easy public health metrics

502
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,560
like lives saved and life expectancy

503
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
tend to trump other considerations

504
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,160
like life quality, cultural quality,

505
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,840
community, mental health.

506
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,160
And I'm not saying that it's not important to save lives,

507
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,000
but I'm saying maybe a less controversial example for me

508
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,200
is like saturated fats, like cheese, right?

509
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,520
It's very easy to track heart attack rates,

510
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,880
longer lifespans, very hard to track culinary joy.

511
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,120
The claim here isn't anti-scientific.

512
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,200
There is a genuine real correlation

513
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
between saturated fats and heart attack rates.

514
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,440
The claim is certain kinds of things

515
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,080
that are easier to measure tend to beat out automatically

516
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
and unthinkingly other harder to measure values.

517
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,800
And try to understand this.

518
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,280
So there's one common response here,

519
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
which is, oh, that's just a bad metric.

520
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,560
We need to find better metrics.

521
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,320
And I had this gut, a lot of the time

522
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,040
when I was thinking about this,

523
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,840
I had this gut response that you wouldn't be able

524
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,640
to find better metrics for certain kinds of things,

525
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
especially central human values.

526
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
And I was trying to understand why.

527
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,520
And I found some answers,

528
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,560
especially from some philosophers like Elizabeth Barnes

529
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,000
who works on the notion of health

530
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,440
and then a bunch of historians

531
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,920
in a field called science and technology studies.

532
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,960
So Theodore Porter unlocked a huge amount

533
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,680
of this stuff for me.

534
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,880
And this is a thing I am literally dying to talk about

535
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
on the BBC science podcast.

536
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,680
Because this, okay.

537
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
So Theodore Porter was a historian

538
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
who was inspired by actually by a bunch of philosophers

539
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,520
I have to claim like Ian Hacking and Bruno Latour.

540
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,360
And he was really interested in why politicians

541
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,760
and administrators tended to unthinking

542
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,440
kind of automatically reach for quantitative justification,

543
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,040
even when the metrics were bad.

544
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,640
So the theory he developed was that

545
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,200
there were two kinds of ways of knowing about the world,

546
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
qualitative and quantitative.

547
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,920
And it's not that quantitative is bad.

548
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,760
It's that each of them is a tool designed

549
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
for a different purpose

550
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,040
with different strengths and weaknesses.

551
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,560
And the problem is compulsively reaching

552
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,440
for the quantitative.

553
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
So qualitative justification, written words,

554
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
is open-ended, dynamic, subtle, rich,

555
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
but it travels badly between contexts

556
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,720
because it requires a huge amount of shared background.

557
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,000
So one way for me, my example is as a professor,

558
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,800
when I write qualitative evaluations of my students,

559
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,960
I can respond along multiple dimensions.

560
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,360
I don't have to declare a single overall score.

561
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,640
I can be like, well, you're really creative,

562
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,440
but it wasn't as rigorous.

563
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
I didn't have to settle that up.

564
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
And I can also use all the rich language,

565
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,480
a philosophy of my class.

566
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
But one, those things don't travel well.

567
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
Like people from the business school

568
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,960
will not understand my comments

569
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,360
and I won't understand their student comments.

570
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,280
And two, they do not aggregate well.

571
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,040
Like thousands of student evaluations don't aggregate.

572
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,720
So what Porter says is quantitative information

573
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,880
is a kind of instrument that's designed

574
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,640
to get around this problem.

575
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,600
When we create quantitative information in an institution,

576
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
we identify a context-invariant kernel.

577
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
We find something that's stable across all contexts,

578
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,360
that everyone from different backgrounds can understand.

579
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
We agree on it, we rigidify it,

580
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,280
and then we can all understand and connect and collect into it.

581
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,600
So in the US, this is GPA, grade point average.

582
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,120
If you get an A, that's a four.

583
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,400
If you get a B, that's a three.

584
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,640
Every student work can be pushed into a single spectrum

585
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,160
that can be quickly averaged

586
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,440
and get a grade point average.

587
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,240
So Porter's insight is that data has been designed to travel.

588
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
His term is that it's portable.

589
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
It's been made to be portable.

590
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,000
And the way it's made to be portable

591
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
is it has context and subtlety stripped out.

592
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,040
It's been designed to be understood across contexts.

593
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,640
So I think the thing that Porter identifies for me

594
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
is that the kind of what I would call

595
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,360
the insensitivity and inhumanity of metrics

596
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
is an essential design feature.

597
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,320
In order to communicate readily at scale,

598
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,800
we have to strip off things that require

599
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,640
high context and nuance to understand.

600
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,120
So the thing that makes metrics powerful,

601
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,920
that is the quick aggregation, the easy comprehensibility,

602
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,120
is achieved precisely at the cost of loss of nuance.

603
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,800
And I'm not saying this is bad in every case.

604
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,880
Like this is also, this is not just metrics.

605
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
This is science, right?

606
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,960
The reason why it's really easy to optimize

607
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,440
for certain things like antibiotics

608
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,680
is that having an antibiotic stop your infection

609
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
is really easy for everyone to see.

610
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,080
Having a lifesaving measure save on someone's life,

611
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,360
that's easy to count.

612
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,480
So those are the kinds of things

613
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,720
that are very easy to collect large scale data for.

614
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,040
Things that are highly variable require high sensitivity

615
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,880
or that are subtle are very hard.

616
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,360
And this is not saying they're not real, right?

617
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,000
It's just saying that they're hard for everyone

618
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,080
to assess quickly and easily.

619
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,120
One of my favorite examples of here is like,

620
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,120
so there are a lot of legal rights that we connect to age.

621
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,120
And what we actually don't, we don't actually care about age.

622
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,320
What we actually care about is intellectual

623
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,480
and emotional maturity, but it would be a disaster

624
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,440
if we granted voting rights based on intellectual

625
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
and emotional maturity, right?

626
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,080
You would need a particular judge.

627
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,880
So there's a case where we make a trade-off

628
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,280
and instead of exactly tracking the thing,

629
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,920
we find a mechanical line in the U.S.

630
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,760
You get to vote if you're 18, right?

631
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,400
And that mechanical line is inarguable.

632
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,320
Everyone assesses it at the same place.

633
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,000
And that's a case where I think it's great.

634
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,840
It is fantastic that for voting,

635
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
we have a clear mechanical line that everyone can replicate.

636
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
But for other things, like, I don't know,

637
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,000
choosing your arts grants or choosing your fitness routine

638
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
or choosing what your career is.

639
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,480
These things, it's less important that our decision procedure

640
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,920
and our targeting procedure are bound by the standard

641
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,600
of absolute context-crossing decontextualization.

642
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,520
I mean, the quick way to put it is that for Porter,

643
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,080
data and therefore metrics are a designed engineer technology

644
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,400
that gets us fast, portable aggregability

645
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,520
at the cost of context.

646
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,440
Yeah, so another thing that you talk about is the appeal of metrics.

647
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,640
And I don't think it's just their tidiness.

648
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,480
It's kind of the kind of authority

649
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,000
that they seem to carry within them.

650
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,280
You know, that's the final verdict on this issue.

651
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,080
This such and such is five out of 10.

652
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,800
That's it, you know, and so we're kind of,

653
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,640
do you think we're less likely to challenge that

654
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,600
because it seems like it is so black and white?

655
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,760
Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of, this has been this puzzle for me

656
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
for the longest time of why these things are so seductive.

657
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
One of the early explanations I had was that

658
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,760
there's this kind of like existential soothingness,

659
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,520
like it's really painful to be exposed to the complexity of real values

660
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,800
and this makes things easy.

661
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,000
That's one explanation.

662
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,280
Another explanation is that it's just easier to communicate.

663
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,240
And Porter tells us why.

664
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,920
It's been designed to be easier to communicate.

665
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,440
Lately, I've been thinking, I even came up with a term for it

666
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,760
literally yesterday in my graduate seminar,

667
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,280
talking to my students about this.

668
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,400
A lot of the times, the way we say that something is objective

669
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,240
versus subjective is that we get someone else's confirmation.

670
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,400
They see it too, right?

671
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,440
That is literally the basic, if you go back to like

672
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,600
old Hume classics of empiricist philosophy,

673
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,640
you know that the feeling of warmth is subjective

674
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,200
because different people experience it differently in the same place

675
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,280
and you know that temperature is objective

676
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,240
because different people will come up with the same measurement, right?

677
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,560
But I kind of think metrics do a kind of objectivity hacking, right?

678
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,520
They create a quick, easy shortcut to agreement and convergence

679
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,960
by zeroing in on features that are highly accessible.

680
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,280
And so this is, I feel like we're headed into like weirdo technical philosophy,

681
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,200
but the thing that's really interesting to me

682
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,360
is the difference between what's real and what's important

683
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,880
and what's easily observable by anybody,

684
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,520
especially under conditions of quickness and speed.

685
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,800
And metrics are designed to create easy convergence at speed among everybody.

686
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,280
They're a shortcut to the appearance of objectivity.

687
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,560
So we've talked about quite a lot there,

688
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,440
a lot of different pitfalls that are in this.

689
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,960
So sort of for someone who's listening, he's thinking, you know,

690
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,520
how can they avoid falling foul of these pitfalls?

691
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,240
You know, what can we learn from games?

692
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,640
And you talk about the notion of play, which is really interesting,

693
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,600
that we can actually apply in our own lives,

694
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
because often it can feel like a lot of these things

695
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
are just completely out of our own control.

696
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,400
Yeah, I mean, not only A, a lot of these systems are out of our control

697
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,640
and a lot of the fixes here are structural.

698
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,320
I'm not going to sit here and say like, we can fix this through individual grit.

699
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,720
Like a lot of this is because of the way the institutions work.

700
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,840
Even there, you can find different relationships to external scoring systems.

701
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,480
And it's important to remember that we do use them all the time.

702
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,720
Even I think even the best relationship to scoring systems in the world

703
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,600
is going to constantly use them because scoring systems

704
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,040
are a response to real needs to understand other people,

705
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,000
to make them transparent to us, to get information quickly.

706
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,400
Like I use rankings when I buy household gadgets.

707
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,560
I don't have the time to research every dishwasher.

708
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,760
I use rankings, right?

709
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
They're summarized compressed information.

710
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,000
What you want to do is realize that they're highly lossy,

711
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,800
highly information devoid, highly thin packages

712
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,200
that are useful, maybe a starting point that are not complete.

713
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,480
And I think games offer us a really good glimpse of what we can do

714
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,280
because I think the life that games,

715
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,960
it's not that they automatically give this to you,

716
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,080
but the life they encourage is a life in which

717
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,520
you enter scoring systems voluntarily

718
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,360
and you choose which ones you want to have

719
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,640
and you can modify them, right?

720
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,720
Like the difference in games, I mean, this is,

721
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,120
and this is in many ways, it's a structural difference, right?

722
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,480
You can house rule your poker game or your Dungeons and Dragons game.

723
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,200
You can't house rule GPA because of the way that metrics function.

724
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,640
But the closest you can approximate to that is something like,

725
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,640
I think games encourage something that I want to call reflective control.

726
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,520
So games encourage trying a scoring system

727
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,600
and then not just assuming that we have to play this particular board game forever,

728
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,480
but thinking afterwards, was it worth it?

729
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,120
Was it fun?

730
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,840
And what you're doing is transitioning between

731
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,240
being absorbed in a particular game goal

732
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,480
and reflecting more deeply on its purpose

733
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
and whether that purpose was rich or meaningful to you.

734
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
And you can just decide, now that game sucked,

735
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,760
I'm not going to play it again.

736
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,000
Or that game was kind of good, but I'm going to modify it.

737
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,680
You have some degree of control and games make that easy

738
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
because there are so many and they're so disconnected.

739
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,520
I think that's the right attitude.

740
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,120
It's much harder to apply in the world

741
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,520
because you don't have these isolated, easily movable between packages

742
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,320
like you do with games.

743
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,800
You get these massive world-spanning systems.

744
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,200
But still, there's a difference between treating your subscriber count

745
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,200
or your likes or your page views as a rough proxy

746
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,800
that gives you some information

747
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,360
versus treating it, taking on as your core value.

748
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,680
I think one crucial part of that is,

749
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,920
if you take it on as your core value,

750
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,320
you don't have a standpoint from which to reflect

751
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
on whether it's working out for you.

752
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,920
If you think the point of your life is just to make the most money

753
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,880
or get the most followers, then that's it.

754
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,240
That's just what you're doing.

755
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,520
But if you're thinking to yourself,

756
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,120
I'm trying to get followers in order to communicate

757
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,320
and connect with people, then you have a stance

758
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,040
from which you can limit your devotion to that simple metric.

759
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,480
